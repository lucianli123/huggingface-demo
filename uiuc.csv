18,2024-09-04 04:26:40,0,"Basically you just need to get to ORD (and fly to Newark from there). You‚Äôve got three options for that

First, you can take a bus. Peoria Charter is a good option because they have service to ORD from three stops in CU every two hours or so (and more on busy travel days like school breaks). It‚Äôll take around 3.5-4 hours to get to ORD and tickets around $40-$50 each way

You could also take the train, but it‚Äôs a bit more complicated, as Amtrak‚Äôs routes from Champaign to Chicago will end up you at Union Station in downtown. From there you‚Äôll need to take the CTA blue line to the airport. It‚Äôs around a 2.5-3 hour train ride plus about 45 minutes on the CTA line. Amtrak tickets are much cheaper though, as they only cost around $15 if you book in advance (plus another $5 for the CTA ticket to the airport). You also have more limited timing options, as there are only 3 trains per day from Champaign to Chicago

Lastly, you could fly. There are two flights a day from Champaign to ORD, on American (but they‚Äôre operated by Envoy Air if that matters to you). Then you just take a connecting flight to EWR. However, this option is going to be the most expensive and will probably cost several hundred dollars",No_Ground,2

Im a former engineer alum, and i worked for the grainger library once upon a time.

My comment is not a slight against you nor engineers at uiuc, rather it was commentary on the pressure that the engineering *college* places on its students such that they are disproportionately more likely to kill themselves. So much more likely infact, that the college's policy has been to lock access to upper floors of nearly every building on the engineering campus due to safety concerns (i'd know as i worked in one such building). However, there are no such safety concerns among the most liberal arts buildings, as the rates of mental health crises are measurably lower among liberal arts students, which is reflected in the data, and thus rooftop access is not only permissible, but is often public access and often encouraged.

But what do i know; maybe thats just a high-minded analysis that the liberal arts college filled my head with that cant be translated into a Natural Language for your brain process, because clearly you couldnt read between the lines and understand that my comment had nothing to do with you, but rather the school ecosystem. 

As i said, engineers havent changed; not in the toxic academic environment they create both in-class, out-of-class and online, nor in their arrogance in assuming every conversation revolves around them, nor in their inability to perceive real societal issues that can't be expressed in formulas.

Sincerely, a former engineer of UIUC.",Pwnda123,15

However with most people, they aren‚Äôt actually evil or even ill intentioned, just perhaps feeling overburdened and under appreciated and taking out those feelings in non constructive or hurtful ways. If there are admin you will have to work with regularly, I encourage you to just keep things polite and a bit friendly, consistently hold up your end of interactions, and then calmly keep asking for what you need. You‚Äôll be here for years and there is time to form a professional interpersonal relationship.

But they are also the public face of the various offices and departments in the university and it's not unreasonable to hold them to a degree of professionalism commensurate with their position and responsibilities. Students, especially at the graduate level, are in the same community as admins; they are not above us. They are here to help us get the resources we need. It's okay to communicate to someone that they are not fulfilling some aspect of their job.

Stempad is a writing tool, similar to word or Notion--you don't have to install plugins, learn a new language or compile anything in order to start writing.

The result is less exact control over certain specifics like margins, line height in pixels, etc. but far higher speed and ease of use. It also comes with certain features that latex lacks, such as running code. Let me know if that makes sense!",someethingrandom2,2

I‚Äôve already reviewed it, I guess I‚Äôm just nervous about the application process. I know it‚Äôs almost impossibly competitive, and that LAS are the only ones who can directly transfer to engineering without doing ICT or Prep.

I already have a GPA and it‚Äôs ~3.5 from community college dual-enrollments/AP transfers. They gave me this GPA even though I graduated High School this year in May. I need to get higher grades this year, I know. Prior to that, I had an ~3.8 unweighted GPA in high school.

241,2024-09-03 15:19:44,1,"Thank you for your comment! I'm so glad I have someone to relate to.. everyone just seems so set on their major and I feel so behind.

The thing with me and design is that I can imagine it, even with great detail, but I can't put it to paper. I can draw structures and replicate, but that's like it. Actual creative thinking? I mentally cannot. Maybe if I tried hard enough, but then I also heard that ROI for architecture is in the dumps so it wouldn't really be worth all the mental stress

I'm gonna visit the FAA office and ask if the structural licensing exam applies to arch. It sounds really interesting. Thanks for bringing it up

And construction? Love it! The course outline for Arch studies seems a lot more design-based than what they advertise, which is a bit sad. The only structural/technical courses you would take are during your Sophomore year. The two years after that? Design studios. Arch studies at UIUC used to be Arch Engineering. Idk why they changed it.

I heard directly from TAs that physics and calc classes are usually the ""weeding"" classes to see who can really succeed. Honestly... it might get me too lol

And it sounds like you've got a solid plan! From what I saw, UIUC has top ranking for Structural eng if you wanna go there again

In my original post, I mentioned Missouri S&T. Idk about masters, but they offer undergrads a choice to do both Civil Eng and Arch Eng dual degree, so it might be good to check up on that if you would still be interested",vivuin,1
242,2024-09-03 15:15:40,2,"I think it varies from my experience. 

Adults, families, and organizations tend to tailgate, and students tend to go to bars before but primarily after the game. 

Imo it wouldn't hurt to get a parking spot because parking during games is crazy to begin with, then maybe check out Green St and see what the energy is and make a decision from there?

Green Street is the heart of campustown and has tons of different food options. All of which are pretty good!

Legends is a fun Illini themed dive bar with decent food, and Kams is our most popular ""nightclub"" esk student bar. Murphys is also a pretty relaxed pub with decent food. Illini Inn is a more neighborhood bar vibe and is nestled in Greek row again with decent food. 

While I personally enjoy Lion, I would steer clear of it! 

Downtown Champaign is also filled with really high-quality restaurants and isn't too far from campus town.",medikaii,3
243,2024-09-03 15:15:40,2,"Tailgate. It's college football. Students tend not to tailgate because its expensive as a student if your parents aren't paying, but as adults with adult income, all of you chipping in some money to tailgate shouldn't be much of an issue. In reality, it probably costs a similar amount of money to send bars vs tailgate, but students are much happier spending that money purely on booze than on a tailgating setup lol. 

Parking is $25 day of (might be $20 if you prepay, but I've never done it so idk how it works). If you have multiple cars, I recommend finding a random university lot with meters a ways away from the stadium and parking any additional cars there (most metered university lots are free on weekends) and taking a bus back to the stadium for free. That way you only pay for the one car and can just pay $5 per guy for parking. 

As far as places to go, Green Street is great for students, but options are more limited for adults (most adults don't want to go to a club-esque college bar and eat drunk student food after a game lol). The best options tho are likely Legends and Murphy's. They're both bars with food, and bar wise, much closer to a true bar while places like Kams or Lion are trying imitate more of nightclub vibes. Off campus tends to be where most people go out of college, specifically going to downtown Champaign. This is where the majority of good local resteraunts are at. There's a lot of good ones from Blackdog. Guidos, Esquire Lounge, etc. Plus I think 1-2 breweries are in there as well if you're into that. Never been to them tho. If you want more sitdown chain types of places, they're scattered throughout town, but mostly located on and around Prospect Ave, north of 74. That's where you'll find your Red Robins, Longhorn Steakhouse, BDubs, etc, and it's also where our Portillos is.",JtotheC23,2

Keep in mind that you can‚Äôt simply ‚Äúfile for residency after a year or so.‚Äù

To be considered an Illinois resident for purposes of admission/tuition you will need to be a bonafide resident of the state of Illinois for 12 continuous months PRIOR TO enrolling in any college or university in the state. That would mean that you ‚Äî and your family, if you‚Äôre a dependent ‚Äî would have to establish residency in Illinois for 12 full months prior to you enrolling in any college in the state.

1. It's actually awesome that he showed his true colors now - imagine this happening after all the time and effort you invested into him/the relationship. 

2. You can't make someone love you. There were times where I went on a date and it went great and then you're all excited and next day you are planning the next date and you get a message saying ""I don't think this is gonna work out"". It's the worst feeling - it makes you think did I do something wrong, what changed, what I could have done better, etc. You will learn to stop doing that, but it's easier if you keep reminding yourself that you can't make someone love you, and if you do, it's not gonna be for long.",lolillini,26

546,2024-09-02 11:57:26,286,"I'm not a student, so you should watch your assumptions there. Your original post references people below the poverty line - MTD is free for them. It's also free for seniors and has last-mile services for folks with accessibility issues (which Veo and similar pay services actually don't - because they're largely unusable for seniors, people with balance issues, etc.). 

As for your last paragraph - that's a straw man argument. If you have some actual data about the topic post it. Otherwise you're just making things up in a way that bolsters your argument disingenuously. Comparing a bus to an ebike would of course be ludicrous, but how about lifetime cost per user-trip for an MTD bus vs an equivalent number of user-trips for an escooter? Doubt you could find that data, but I imagine (because of economies of scale) the cost/benefit would be heavily weighted toward the bus as an inherently more efficient form of people mover at scale. 

And I do agree that people need to pick these up, but I disagree that these 'services' are a public good, which is what you're implying. They are profit-making enterprises, and nothing more, and any public support of them should be minimized so they survive (or fail) entirely on their own merits (and so public support can be provided where it's more appropriate - to publicly provided services like a mass-transit district).",Hairy-Dumpling,10

I met my friends through a combination of classes, RSOs, and dining hall. If you haven‚Äôt joined RSOs, join a few. I‚Äôve made some genuinely good friends from them. Besides that, talk to people in class. Try and find someone to sit with in lecture. Especially discussion, sit at the same table every time and you‚Äôll make friends with the people around you.

I would also randomly go up to people in the dining hall and ask to sit with them - it‚Äôs actually how I met my roommate

One other thing to remember is that deep friendships take time to form. Despite how it may seem right now, literally every freshman‚Äôs friends are all surface level friendships. You‚Äôre not gonna become best friends with someone overnight, that will take 1-2 semesters to do (probably more, this is at the bare minimum, if you‚Äôre lucky).

It‚Äôs just the start of the semester, though. You‚Äôll work it out. 

Three things I wish I could go back in time and tell myself:
- Find study groups. Tackling everything by yourself makes it harder and more time-consuming. Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel. 
- Take advantage of office hours. Start early enough on your work that you can go in with specific questions and share what you‚Äôve tried so far. 
- Learn how to self-assess and identify when you‚Äôre missing a concept, and self-teach. There are plenty of resources for early engineering classes out there.",phirre,18

HL - Math AA, Chemistry, Physics
SL - Psych, LitLang, Spanish Ab Initio

To answer your questions -

1. Yes, we're one of the best engineering programs in the country with a large international population 

2. Both work well, we have a semiconductor minor you might want to look into

3. The subjects choice doesn't matter nearly as much as you think it does. Which one will you do better in and like better? Chem HL is ridiculously hard and doesn't help at all for CE, since it's not required for us in college. It is required for EE and could get you out of some painful classes here

4. Not the best person to answer this, but I don't think you need a PhD. Family I know in similar fields (silicon design at Intel) are doing just fine with a masters

5. Yes, but iirc it deducts from your OPT/CPT. Not an international student so can't provide the best help here

The Maize place is pretty expensive, but I once got a Huitlacoche appetizer from there, took it home and put it over rice and a vegetable to stretch it (was two solid meals when I added a fruit and a little extra cheese.) You could probably do this with some of their other apps. You can also get a salad from the real Mama Zia's on the main drag for about 8-9$ if you're paying cash (this includes tip and tax). I've got some coupons for restaurants in the mail on the first week - make sure to keep an eye on those.

I'm not certain what would happen in if you were *accepted* for spring admission to MCS and then applied for MSCS admission in the fall, but **my best guess is that your MSCS application would be automatically rejected**.

You are definitely not allowed to apply to more than one CS graduate program *at the same time.*  If you did submit simultaneous MCS and MSCS applications,  your MSCS application would be automatically rejected, and possibly your MCS applciation as well.  Similarly, if you already have a master's degree in CS or a nearby field, you can't be admitted to another master's degree program in CS.

But like I said, I'm not certain whether your plan is allowed.  You really should ask someone in the [CS graduate advising office](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-forms-advising-resources/graduate-advising-contacts).  Don't just take my pessimistic word for it!

Regardless of what they tell you, my recommentation is that you decide which master's degree you actually want, *and then apply only to that one*; don't waste your time, or the admissions committee's time, by applying to both.

* If you want to do reserach, apply for MSCS (but remember that you won't be admitted unless at least one professor declares that they're willing to be your advisor).
* If you don't want to do research (or you can't identify a likely advisor) then apply for MCS.

Either way, you should simultaneously apply to similar programs at half a dozen other universities, so that all your eggs aren't in one basket.

To answer your final question: Yes, applications to MCS and MSCS both require three recommendation letters, a statement of purpose, and a complete set of transcripts.  Admission to the MCS program is based primarily on grades, as long as you have a decent computer science background.  Admission to the MS program requires some evidence of research potential to be visible in your statement and your rec letters.",jeffgerickson,1

You can have gas and electric appliances so it will vary, but your heating/cooling, water heater, stove/oven will be the items that cause the largest amount of change tied to use. 

Your bill sounds about right, not knowing if you have central air or window units, washer/dryer, etc. You could also put a maintenance request in to have your furnace filter checked/changed, or check/clean the filters in your ac window units (depending on what you have).

1010,2024-08-31 03:11:35,38,"Academics - let yourself be curious, go to office hours and ask good questions, but don‚Äôt limit yourself to what is in the curriculum. Go to the library and find books outside what you are assigned that peak your interest. While you don‚Äôt have a ton of time for this it can really help broaden your understanding of your field. You will have more resources available to you here than almost anytime in your life and most don‚Äôt take advantage of it.

Outside of academics, that last point still stands. Your college years are some of the best for your own self discovery and development. Try as many different things as you can at least once. Don‚Äôt think you would like something? Well you never know until you try! If a friend mentions they are part of a club, be curious - ask what it is about and if you can tag along and see. You might find right away that the activity isn‚Äôt really for you and that is great to know! You might also find something that sparks a lifelong passion in you, but you never would have found it if you didn‚Äôt try.

UIUC is extremely diverse, really try and take advantage of that and make friends who are not like you. While it is easy to simply find the people who are most like you, you might be pleasantly surprised to find amazing friendships or romantic relationships with those who are very different to you. You can learn so much simply by having a broad group of friends who are not all alike. This cross pollination of friend groups and interests can lead to some very fun times!",UIUCsquash,5

All three of my kids got the cleaning, painting and carpet cleaning charges and my wife and I with the kids spent 2 days cleaning and the apts were spotless and we have pictures to prove. 

The point I would like to make here is our contracts had Urbana municipal code quoted in them (even though our apts were in Champaign) that we had to sign/initial and in section 12.5 towards the end it clearly states that unless there were damages above and beyond normal wear‚Ä¶the security deposit CANNOT be used for regular cleaning, painting and carpet cleaning. 

And‚Ä¶if there are damages found, that the lessor/landlord must provide written proof of these damages/repairs to lessee within 30 days of move out date.

They've all been involved in overcharging students for cleaning fees when leases end for years and years. They rely on students being naive and moving out-of-town, accepting reduced deposits or forfeiting entire deposit amounts. Unfortunately, the owners of these companies donate heavily to local politicians, and the local city councils in both Champaign and Urbana allow them to continue these practices. The University has a hands-off policy as well, since this is all done by LLC companies, not publicly accountable agencies. The OP's plan to organize a class action lawsuit is a great idea, but local attorneys MIGHT be difficult to find to help out, because again...they are allied with local real estate interests. Consulting with UIUC's student legal services might be the key to change, but I hope the Illinois Attorney General's office gets involved: they have the power to sanction and fine these companies, and take legal action if necessary.

Second, talk to the instructor because they can help.    People do start to behave better if the instructor is heading towards them.  In one case, I put a ""reserved"" sign on a seat that someone needed for exams.

Third, show up early if possible.  This is particularly helpful at the start of term, when people don't know one another and haven't yet settled into a favorite seat.   

Fourth, as others have said, speak up.   Many people find this hard, but it's an essential skill and it gets easier with practice.  Other students are often preoccupied and/or don't know what you need.   A surprising range of people will become helpful once they see what the problem is.

It also helps set a standard for the class for other students who might need those seats, and also for those students to be aware in their other classes too. Mostly understandable to not want to have the burden of doing so. 

Diff of course is that in a bathroom you have few stalls, but in a classroom there are many non-accessible seats to take and leave those available. 

Very happy OP made this PSA, could just be the introverted version of the above to deal with your classroom situation hopefully through the grape vine at least.

ETA: I was homeschooled and have social anxiety, and found practicing scripts or dialogue and thinking of myself from a third person perspective can help. Being assertive and having a situation go desirably doesn't have to be a privilege of assertive people.

There were real barriers to education that the general population just accepted as burdens to bear for those who weren't able-bodied.

Stepping back from this, melatonia is right:   leave the lefthanded desks free for the folks who need them.

1323,2024-08-30 09:20:44,49,"General advice for bats in your house (I‚Äôve had this happen in my house in Urbana twice in the last 10 years). 

If it is flying around inside, quickly open an exterior door or window. The bat wants to get outside and is flying around trying to find an exit. They can sense the outside air and will leave. 

Bats cannot fly for very long. They will land on a vertical surface like drapery or blinds. In both instances in my home they were brown bats and they clung to a dark brown fabric strip on the blinds. They can be very hard to spot. 

Most likely the bat is still in your apartment unless there was an open door or window. They don‚Äôt seem very good at returning through the small entrances they used to get into the house. 

Bats are dangerous because of rabies. You can contract rabies even through minor contact with a bat (a scratch is sufficient, doesn‚Äôt have to be a bite). Untreated rabies in humans is nearly always fatal. You may want to go to student health services just in case. 

So, this is a serious situation. You need to have someone come to your apartment and find the bat and how it got in. Even if you toss it out, it may try to regain access via the same method it originally entered (if the bats are nesting in an attic or crawl space adjacent to your apartment).

I would not let the landlord blow off the situation.",Commercial_Stress,3
1324,2024-08-30 09:20:44,49,"We used to regularly get bats in our house in Champaign. It‚Äôs almost impossible to find out how they get in, and as other posters have noted, they are really bad at leaving. They often enter low down but will always fly up to a higher floor if they can, and will end up in the southwest room‚Äîin our house, the master bedroom. If you can find them the next morning, animal control will remove them, usually by grabbing them bare-handed and stuffing them into a bag for later release. 

The chances of a bat having rabies is very, very low (especially compared to other animals), but not zero. We thought our son might have been bitten, went to the doc who said, ‚Äúnope. Not a bat bite,‚Äù and that was that. 

We looked into having our house bat-proofed. It was like $20,000 ten years ago, which seemed absurd. We just lived with the occasional bat surprise (always late summer to fall‚Äîthey think cool air coming out of the house from the AC is a cave), found them in the morning and had them removed.",Aggravating_Chip2376,2

Let's pump the brakes. Sure, we don't hear of too many people getting and dying of it. However, if the bat does have rabies and it's transmitted to a human, once symptoms show, that person will not die humanely. This video shows what generally happens:

The bus service is a great go-to in a pinch, and can either give you directions or possibly take you partway there.  They run all day and night.  Be aware they only stop on the side of the street of the sign, so if you miss one on the other side, wait a few minutes and one will be rolling up to your side. 

If you‚Äôre on campus and near an open university office or admin building, those are also a halfway decent option, so long as you can find a faculty or staff member. 

Gambling on the kindness of random strangers, especially if you are a woman, is extremely risky sober, much less inebriated.  

As far as police in this scenario go, only approach marked and obvious vehicles or officers.  I say this because of what happened to Yingying Zhang, who was lost and running late before a guy claiming to be an off duty cop offered her a ride.

Just to give more info on SafeRides as someone else mentioned, here's the link to MTD's website with a page specifically about SafeRides (if you don't want to click a link you can find the page by searching ""UIUC SafeRide"" in your browser):¬†https://mtd.org/maps-and-schedules/uiuc-learn-to-ride/saferides/




SafeRides are available OVERNIGHT even during times when the standard bus routes aren't active, and are available until 6am during the fall and spring semesters. **There is no charge, you just show your iCard.** There are some limitations, such as SafeRides not being available far outside of standard bus route limits and not being available to pick up someone directly from a bar, but essentially if you can get to a bus stop or 24-hour university building or something within the specifications listed on the web page, they will pick you up.




UIUC also has SafeWalks available until 2:30am during the semester (search in your browser for ""UIUC SafeWalk"" if you don't want to click this link:¬†https://police.illinois.edu/services/safewalks/); again **there is no charge** for this either, they'll send (I think 2, but I'm not sure) student patrol officers to walk with you to wherever you need to go. Student patrol officers aren't police, although they can contact the police directly if something concerning or dangerous happens (i.e. if you're being followed and threatened).




It would also be good to memorize a couple of UIUC buildings that are open 24 hours a day, so if you need to get into a public space with people around quickly you have options. Grainger is usually open 24 hours a day on weekdays during regular semesters, you just need your iCard (I think your ID in the Illinois App would also be accepted) to enter the building after 10pm, and there's Internet service and public computers there that you can use to contact someone to help you get home.

However, please see above where I said I couldn‚Äôt comment on whether or not the company is predatory overall. You‚Äôve set up a straw man version of my argument to then knock it down. The point of my original comment is that towing companies are not, in fact, driving around looking for cars to tow. They don‚Äôt have a list of what cars belong or not. They don‚Äôt make that call, and the threshold for making it is pretty high. The only instance in which a tow could be made from campus without the spot admin handling it is if it‚Äôs literally posing a hazard, ie blocking a fire lane or impeding traffic.

Further, you experienced an edge case and it sucks. But the vast majority of campus tows occur when someone knowingly places their car in a spot it does not belong and leaves it there so long that it has to be removed to allow others to do their job. The tow company has to pay a professional to move the car without damaging it; they have to be legally responsible for it to ensure it isn‚Äôt damaged or stolen while in their possession; and they have to have the staff to make it available to the right person upon request. They aren‚Äôt charging a ton because they are rolling in cash. They are charging because cars are expensive to move and guarantee.",neurobeegirl,-5

My guess would be at Orchard Downs they have a nighttime contact who is responsible for monitoring the lot.

But a tow company being contacted by the parking authority, towing an identified vehicle that has been confirmed as illegally parked, and charging a publicly posted fee for its removal and storage is simply not acting in a predatory manner under any reasonable definition.

To put this in perspective, if your car breaks down, it will cost about $100 dollars as an industry standard to have it towed to a local repair place. That‚Äôs just for the tow itself and these days probably on the low end. This isn‚Äôt some inflated fee. This is specialist labor that needs expensive equipment that must be purchased and maintained. Yes it‚Äôs painful to pay this cost without insurance or similar to help, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs exploitative to charge it.

(Note: this email was working 1 year ago and I'm really hoping it's still active)

The carpet cleaning is going to be hard to get around. Unless you have a receipt for getting it professionally cleaned or something. Lots of leases have some kind of clause about getting the carpet professionally cleaned after a lease. You may want to check your lease paperwork for anything like this.

The painting, you can dispute. Inform them the you believe the walls were left with no damage beyond normal wear and tear, and that you should not be held accountable to cover that cost.

You can question the cleaning costs, and there's a decent chance to get a partial refund. If you took pictures of your apartment as you left it, you've got more leverage to work with.

Sadly, Ugroup does something like this with many students in Champaign (Urbana has better tenant's rights). It'll take a couple emails, including reminders, but you should get some money back if you dispute the charge soon.

In my experience all the healthcare options in this town (aside from low-income clinics) are equally expensive. I do think student insurance does cover partially treatments that McKinley can‚Äôt do. Also I don‚Äôt want to assume anything about your financial situation but Carle has a much better sliding scale payment plan than OSF or Christie.

1829,2024-08-29 03:35:06,0,"So I rabbit holed on this.   
  
Per your question, it's less about *implementing* it here and more that, for the most part, all of the sororities and fraternities are national organizations, with specific chapters at given colleges.   
  
Most of the Greek Letter organizations on campus are social sororities/fraternities. Chi Omega is a national panhellenic sorority (female social fraternity), with UofI hosting the Omicron chapter, while Alpha Sigma Phi is a national interfraternity council fraternity (male social fraternity), with UofI hosting the Eta chapter. Generally, college/university chapters are named in order of the Greek alphabet based on when each chapter of a given frat/sorority was founded, so the chapter at each sorority/frat's founding school is the Alpha chapter.  
  
There are also Black Greek Letter Organizations (ex. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., and culturally affiliated fraternities and sororities at Illinois (ex. Alpha Phi Gamma National Sorority Inc. \[Asian affiilated\]).

Not all fraternities and sororities are Greek letter named (ex. the agriculture-focused FarmHouse International Fraternity, with its ""Illinois"" chapter), but most are.

For more info about who/what they are, see this page: [https://fsaffairs.illinois.edu/organizations](https://fsaffairs.illinois.edu/organizations) 

Additionally, there are groups like Alpha Kappa Psi, which is a national business fraternity, and UofI has the Epsilon chapter on campus.  Business fraternities and the like are RSOs, not social fraternities, though they use the same naming convention.  There are also many Greek-letter honor societies like Phi Beta Kappa, which may be discipline specific, or multi-disciplinary, and have varying qualifications for acceptance.",metheglyn,2

It is true that a lot of talented people come to Grainger, but you can't possibly know that you're in the 10th percentile. Go to class, pay attention, do the work, and you'll likely be just fine academically. UIUC isn't taking in unqualified candidates to fill seats in Grainger, so you definitely belong here.

I had a few friends from high school there (I was in state) but I hardly connected with them the entire 4.5 years I was there. I made friends that I‚Äôm still cool with today because I was always around and went to stuff I enjoyed and did stuff I was into and I fostered those connections. Search yourself to find what you‚Äôre into and what you enjoy or what you want to discover in life. Then pursue that with fervor. Be yourself and people with similar interests will gravitate to you.

Prior to university most friendships formed from proximity and years of shared experiences. At Uni it‚Äôs all about repeated contact in shared activities typically. Study groups (not sure why your classmates are not good from your perspective) are often a way to meet people repeatedly and there by sometimes meet people they know. RSOs are the other place where shared interests provide a basis for developing longer term connections. 

you evidently have an apartment and as such you are able to invite people over for study or project meetings or pot lucks or game nights what ever. Best way to convince people you are interested in making connections is to invest in them. Invite the to something. It‚Äôs work because everybody is pretty busy. 

a final suggestion is join a volunteer group doing something in town or on campus. Again a shared area of interest.",old-uiuc-pictures,3

You will meet a lot of people. For me, the ""dry talk"" is a filter. Is this a person I'll ever see again? Is this a person I enjoy? How do I connect with them? Find people that share your common interests, are in your major, or have similar backgrounds. The dry talk should help you narrow it down.

2011,2024-08-28 22:45:32,5,"A lot of the frustration with the counseling center comes from misplaced expectations on what it actually offers, which is mostly the University‚Äôs fault for not promoting it properly.  The counseling center‚Äôs purpose is to help students, but they can only accommodate a small amount of long term clients due to the size of the student body and the limited amount of counselors they have. They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options. People expect a team of about 20 counselors to be a catch-all solution to the entire breadth of potential mental health issues of 50,000 students, but really they are a crisis management/referral service. If you are keeping all that in mind I think it‚Äôs worth trying out. I doubt the counseling center will somehow make your social skills worse, and if you‚Äôre just looking to vent I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be fine for that.",weddz,8

I've downloaded the Harvest Market, County Market, and Schnucks apps. Those are the places I'll visit the most that aren't Costco or Target. Every Wednesday, or every other Wednesday, they release their weekly ad and new coupons. Sometimes you can find really good deals on food and then I plan my meals around that. You can create free accounts with all three to get access to their ""exclusive"" coupons. For example, County Market has a Penny Pincher coupon of 0.79 for Creamette brand pasta (limit 4 boxes).

I also wait for large sales on meat. Schnucks marks down meat prices if they're reaching the sell-by date. I vacuum seal them and put them in the freezer for later. Aldi is also an affordable place for groceries year-round and often has the lowest prices for things, but you'll need a car or to take the bus to get to either one.

Green st is just poorly planned. Incompatible decisions have been made, particularly to keep it a throughway for personal vehicles. A throughway because cars are not allowed to stop so green st is not a destination for them. And now it‚Äôs a mess. It‚Äòs unpleasant to walk, drive and bike there.

My best guess is it was probably in the 25-40 range. I was a covid freshmen so I had the covid weight on top of the freshmen weight. I was a little overweight my senior year of high school (nothing crazy, just a little chubby), and while I'm still in regularly available clothes sizes (still only an XL), there's a significant difference as far as ""roundness"" between recent photos and photos when I was in high school. 

It happens because freshmen are suddenly exposed to basically all they can eat. If you're not a picky eater, you can easily eat for 2+ people each meal off the 10/45 meal plan that's seemingly most common, plus $45 of snacks and other food you have to use each week. You need to actively working out to not gain weight when eating like that, and most freshmen don't do that outside the honeymoon period of their access to the Arc. If you can either make that not be a honeymoon period or control your eating habits at the dining halls (harder than you may think for most people), or better yet do both, you'll be fine.",JtotheC23,2

in terms of off campus, I saw (on indeed) that the Champaign park district was hiring a part time receptionist to work M-F 6-9AM, which might not interfere with your classes and would be good if you don't like getting up early. there were other places looking for Receptionists as well, but most want someone who can work consistent M-F hours, which may not work with your class schedule.

There was stuff in the apartment from previous residents that they did not clean out, a hair tie with hair on it, tons of used kitchen supplies. They said they could fix the ceiling and seemed to have thought painting over it was a good idea? I told them i need out of the lease as none of these things were mentioned and it leaves the apartment in unhealthy living conditions. They tried to make me pay the whole remainder of the rent for the lease or find someone to move in. I told them that as both me and my animals are sick and this is passing health code violations that I am not doing that and I am moving out immediately. They then asked me to at least pay for the next 2 months as well. I stated that I paid the first months rent when I didn‚Äôt even live there for longer than a month. I said I was paying for  them.

2599,2024-08-27 13:01:58,16,"A course's grade distribution, how much work is required, and how much students learn are essentially independent variables. Any permutation is possible. There are courses that don't teach much, don't expect much of students, but still make sure to curve the course around a low median grade‚Äîmaybe in hopes of appearing like they are teaching something. There are also well-designed courses where students are appropriately challenged and supported, and where grades reflect what they learn, not adherence to some arbitrary distribution. (This is one of the many reasons why using GPA distribution to determine whether a course is a good one to take is so misguided.)

There are also courses at other universities that operate under the (misguided) assumption that their job is to weed out students. Unfortunately, those courses tend not to be very good at actually teaching the material, and end up really only selecting for students who already know it. This is something we try to be very careful about early in our CS program, since we have many students who enter with various amounts of prior experience.

Our goal throughout the early computer science sequence is for our courses to teach an appropriate amount of material and to give every student a chance to succeed. Yes: Students have to put in the work. That's a hard requirement. And no, we're not chasing high success rates by dumbing down the material or making our courses not appropriately challenging‚Äîour early courses are generally hitting their marks in terms of moving students forward, and cover content comparable with other top programs. But we have an unlimited supply of A-range grades. We will happily give one to any student who learns the material, and we will do our best to make sure every student can.",geoffreychallen,49

So initially you are required to take MSE 396 which is this 3 credit hour course which introduces you to technical writing, lab safety, etc. Then you take MSE 397 for every semester you do research which is 1 credit hour but really is a placeholder for however many hours you want to do your research. I'm pretty sure you do the MSE 396 course if you are planning to do research with a professor who is a part of the MatSE department itself.

I am aware that some of my friends who do research in the MatSE department go through other departments that do pay them money (Beckman Institute-->MatSE prof group). I don't think that they have to take this MSE 396 class like you said. 

When you mean ""Anyone in the department"" I assume MatSE department? I believe that if you do research in a different group then they don't know, it is likely to be at the other department's discretion to train you but don't quote me on that.",Protoflare,1

For 391, the midterms are difficult, but if you know what's up with the MPs and all, should do fine, but this course is also known to take up a huge amount of time.

2960,2024-08-26 14:19:56,0,"If you know the particular author/title you're looking for, the library catalog will point you to where you will find that book. If you're looking to browse, it's a little more challenging in a huge university library than at a bookstore or local library, but it can be done! The Main Stacks and the Literature and Languages Library are your best bets. 

In the Library of Congress system, works of British literature are catalogued as PR (followed by a bunch of numbers) and works of US literature are catalogued as PS (followed by a bunch of numbers). Within those categories, books are arranged by broad chronological order, so the smallest numbers are generally works of or pertaining to the earliest literary periods, and the larger numbers are the most recent. Within each time period, the books are arranged by author's last name. If you go to the actual library and find a map with all the locations of the Library of Congress numbers, you can usually find the vast array of shelves that have books you'd want to read. It's still going to be challenging because works of scholarship and analysis are mixed in with the fiction (e.g., you'll find all the books written ABOUT Toni Morrison and her novels alongside Sula, Beloved, Song of Solomon, etc.), but once you figure the pattern out, it gets easier to skim the shelves.

A simple strategy is to think of a book that you've already read or are curious about), look it up in the catalog to get the LC number for it, and then go to that section of the library, where you'll find other books from the roughly the same period. (Particularly useful if you're interested in novels from non-US/non-British authors, or if you want to explore memoirs, literary nonfiction, and the like).

They allow for people to find and make friends with others in the same situation. This ends up being great when large groups of people with the same end goal make a friend group and continue to help each other out. For example, the physics RSOs lean social, but all the people that show up find friends who will continue to work together in grad school applications, internship applications, etc.",eMburst_,52
2977,2024-08-26 07:49:26,64,"Gonna throw my hat into the ring here because this topic has always been interesting (and a bit frustrating, at the fault of nobody in particular) to me as a lead in both an engineering org targeted at women and an ACM SIG lead (obligatory disclaimer my opinions do not reflect my RSOs opinions, I‚Äôm speaking as an individual, etc). Women‚Äôs orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women‚Äôs orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.

Let‚Äôs say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we‚Äôre gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let‚Äôs say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don‚Äôt necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let‚Äôs say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS‚Äôs job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don‚Äôt really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I‚Äôve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I‚Äôve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women‚Äôs engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I‚Äôd gotten more involved with them sooner. 

I will also say as a final note that I can‚Äôt speak for your individual experience on this (or WECE as an org), but in terms of discourse or drama, the grass is not always greener on the other side. I love both my RSOs and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this, the more hard directional choices you have to make, the more you see go down, the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter, etc. Regardless of the breadth of shenanigans I‚Äôve seen over time, I wouldn‚Äôt trade the effort I‚Äôve put into either of them for the world.",lukewarmdaisies,41

I joined WECE specifically to meet my fellow women in ece because there were so few of usüò¢I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with WECE being more social focused - from what I saw, that‚Äôs why many people joined, so it makes sense to have a focus on social events. My takeaway from WECE is having a community to lean on in a male dominated major/industry, which is very important post college.",grungyb,17

Many academic buildings with a department (major study area) based in it will have a departmental library. Greg Hall, Burrell (I think), Architecture, Music Building, etc. - so over time explore those options too. But the Main library on the south end of Wright Street has some good places. 

Wifi is everywhere in every building and they are starting to add outside Access Points too so you don't need to depend on bleed from inside buildings. 

Some people study in the lobby of Krannert Center (level 5) as there are a lot of tables and some power outlets near stage 5. Enter via teh stairs on Goodwin or any other route and go to level 5.

I personally find agricultural land beautiful but that is due to my heritage. But I have backpacked in a variety of mountains and environs which I also find beautiful. It is not mutually exclusive. In general it is best to not say to prospective neighbors, ""I‚Äôve heard there is no natural scenery down there."" People in this group have chosen to live here for a short or long while and have found the quality of life OK. If you've seen a sunset on the prairie, a meandering prairie river lined with trees, a country estate with formal gardens and woodland trails punctuated with statuary, a dome of stars going on forever, or an orange harvest moon rising over fields of corn in the fall and find those to be pedestrian then yes we have no natural scenery.  ;-)",old-uiuc-pictures,5

3148,2024-08-25 20:04:47,0,"I don't know anything about what chances you have, but I do have a heads up as a working AE that graduated from UIUC 5 years ago. Remember that the vast majority of AE jobs in the US require US Citizenship or Permanent Residence. If you don't have those things, I would look into the aerospace industry in your home country before you make the decision to major in AE, because it will be incredibly difficult for you to get a job in the US after graduation and tuition is very expensive for international students.

I don't want to dissuade you from majoring in AE, I think these are just things that you may want to keep in mind.",mrooch,8
3149,2024-08-25 20:04:47,0,"Your stats seem on par with a lot of people I know in AE, so I would say chances are pretty good. Tuition is 45k a year + room/board + flights back home etc come out to about 65k total a year. 

While you're still in uni it will be difficult to pay it off simultaneously as most of the jobs in AE are ITAR restricted. A few people do get well paying internships in their sophomore and junior years that could help you pay off 1-2 semesters of tuition but these are extremely competitive and you should not rely on them to pay off your tuition. 

General quality is great, in my experience as an international in AE. And yes, do complete your A levels if you want to graduate early and save on some of that international tuition.",aarjaey,3

Grainger for internationals costs $66,358.00 a year for this year, if living on campus, which is required freshman year.  You can knock that down a little sophomore year and on, by living off campus.

But it might not have even been put on there by actual students. Possibly just agitators, waiting for the semester to begin so they can once again start stirring up controversy.

But also, if we could go back to the days where the majority of a public university's operational costs were paid for with tax money, then universities wouldn't be so dependent on investments/endowments (or high tuition either, for that matter.)

So be smart, people, and vote for the party that actually wants to fund public higher education, not the party that wants to get rid of the Ed. Dept. and privatize everything.

And furthermore, people need to be reminded that pretty much all diversified investment vehicles that pool financial resources across an array of investments to spread out risk have some of the capital going into defense companies like Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems, ultimately supplying the Israeli military.

So if these protestors were being the least bit honest, they wouldn't be specifically targeting universities, but rather ALL large institutions that have endowments, trusts, mutual funds, ETFs, private equity funds etc...

The difference between only disliking something internally and actively trying to find a way to fix the wrong are two completely different things. I am not fetishizing persecution or calling the public stupid. I used the word mindless. Mindless because there is clearly a generational bias here. The public chooses to see the videos of Palestinian babies dying, cries, and then continues to ignore what is actually funding this (i.e. tuition money, taxes, etc).

As Palestinians, it is mind blowing that you think I wake up wanting sympathy. It doesn't matter if you don't understand what I am going through. You never will. Because you can't. And that is ok. But what is not ok is you silencing the movement's desire to give opportunities to human beings that I grew up with in Palestine. What is not ok is me funding the bombs that fall on the heads of my cousins through my tuition and sitting silently. Historically, protests like the pro-Palestine movement have proven to bring change. Unfortunately, sitting at a round table with officials and listening to the same old excuses and ""sympathy"" is not effective.

You might say, well, all corporations support Israel directly or indirectly in their military operations. Fine. Let's take the example of Caterpillar. If Caterpillar does 5 things that are not related to supplying weapons to Israel, there is no harm in sending money for those 5 things. But there needs to be a contractual agreement that the institution will only fund those 5 things. The 6th, providing weapons to Israel, will be unacceptable. I understand that in this day and age, it is difficult to completely divest from corporations that supply other countries, regardless of if you agree with their policies or not. It isn't impossible though. And sending money to corporations blindly without specifically allocating it to acceptable causes (such as internships and non-war related causes) is unacceptable.

Realize most classrooms did not have A/C until conversions started in the late 1970's. 

The first dorms to have A/C were built in the mid 1960's. 

Though it is a bit warmer at times now basically people were used to living without A/C so it was not as big a deal. Now that people move in and out of A/C the discomfort is more noticeable. 

That capacity was just not built into buildings. More dorm rooms would have A/C now if it were not for COVID when much of this kind of work had to stop for 2-3 years.",old-uiuc-pictures,6

3534,2024-08-24 21:18:26,1,It was closed a few years ago a cost savings measure telling folks in FAR to use PAR.  The eating habits of students have changed since it was built. Not as many students eat 3 meals a day in their home dining hall - let along 3 meals per day on a meal plan. More eating in the room or buying things on the go. So I guess capacity studies allowed them to close the dining hall in Busey Evans and the one in FAR. Also when they increased the capacity of the ISR hall during its complete rebuild 4 years ago it allowed more students to eat meals up in mid-campus and not need to rush back to FAR/PAR for a lunch or evening meal.,old-uiuc-pictures,3

Aldi is not realistically walkable, and you can't walk through fields (at least if anything is growing there). You would likely have to drive or take the bus to most places, though the bus goes right through Winfield, it can still take awhile to get onto campus.",illstillglow,5
3542,2024-08-24 20:08:13,3,"Winfield Village requires a buy-in payment. One bedroom is about $7,000. Two bedroom is about $8,000. Two bedroom townhouse is about $9,000. Three bedroom townhouse is about $10,000.  There are waiting lists, you cannot just move right in, and the list can be a wait of anywhere from a few months to a year, maybe more. The monthly rental charge is very reasonable, under $700 for the two bedroom townhouses, which include internet, heating, water, sewage. It's convenient to local shopping. You can walk to stores but there is a lot of traffic, but there is a sidewalk down to Aldi's, and you CAN walk to it (it's about1/2 miles.)

You'd probably end up driving almost everywhere, but at least it's a short and easy drive.

Theres plenty of space to walk around between Winfield, Parkview, Lake Park, etc. where you could walk a dog, but you wouldn't be able to go anywhere useful.

I did CS at first, but transferred to ECE, when I realized there were too many bootcamp/self taughts going for entry-level software jobs.  
There are way more software jobs than hardware, BUT there are also way more people applying for those jobs.  
With an ECE degree, as long as you pick the right electives such as the class where you build an OS, you should still know the main fundamentals of a CS degree.

Ask your self:  
What do I want to do after college:  
1. Build the newest computer components, where you need to do math, physics, and machine code and simple algorithms (mainly divide and conquer)  
2. Build complex software, that requires planning, reading, a little bit of math (or sometimes a lot of math), and logic and simple algorithms (mainly divide and conquer and sorting)  
3. Build simple software that requires very complex math and algorithms to find patterns from data sets  
4. I dont know yet  


If you chose:  
1. Go with ECE  
2. Go with CS  
3. Go with Math or Stats + CS  
4. Go with ECE. you still get more than enough knowledge of CS to work a purely software job, and enough math to get a data engineering/scientists job IF you really practice your diff eqs/linear algebra/algorithms.

A young lady that was decently dressed (didnt look homeless or anything) came up to me saying she needed money because her car got towed. She asked me for $300 (towing fee and a ride to the lot). I believed her because that's how much I paid when my car got towed. We went to a nearby ATM and before I gave her the money she wrote me a check. Little did I know, that you could verify if a check is valid or if the amount on the check would bounce just by calling the customer service number on the back of the check. I accepted the check and went on the train home. I knew in my gut something was wrong and that the check was fake, but I decided to ignore my gut feeling because I really wanted to help her out and even if I was getting scammed, I was fine with losing the $300, because I was going to make a lot more the next morning because I had a hobby that was paying well at the time. When I got home, tried to verify the check , but it was invalid. It turns out the check was that of a deceased person in Indiana and that the account has been closed. I still have the check to remind me to trust my gut and not always my head

¬†Definitely read the syllabus and go back to it if you have questions about the class (grading, due dates, etc.). It will have most of the information you need about the course and Dr. Marville and your TA will get exhausted from students asking questions that can be in the syllabus.¬†



There is extra credit you can get but you have to complete the assignment fairly early in the semester. I would take advantage of this while you can even if you think you might be okay. It is a good opportunity to boost your grade.¬†


Use the chemistry learning center (CLC) and your TA for help. If you don't like your particular TA, other TAs can help you in the CLC.¬†


Discussion sections are not optional (at least not for this particular professor) and you will have clicker questions to answer each class period.¬†

My situation is even worse: Despite the things you mentioned above, I‚Äôm an international student. In the first 3 months I really couldn‚Äôt communicate properly because my English was so bad.

4113,2024-08-23 15:56:25,77,"I had quite bad social anxiety as a teen and struggled to make friends most of my life, being a total loner until I was 20. (Not that it's easy now, but it's not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not ""get"" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, ""People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations"" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).",allfrappedout,2

I was (and still am a bit) pretty introverted and tried small talk during welcome week and classes during my first semester and didn‚Äôt really make friends outside of class. My roommate was pretty much my own friend my freshman year. 

Sophomore year came around and I ended up making some of my best friends that I hangout with to this day in my classes and labs after chatting with them and asking to study outside of class. Having to meet so many new people is still very tiring and anxiety inducing but it will pay off once you find the people that made it worth it.

Just don‚Äôt give up on making friends, it‚Äôs ok to feel left out right now but you have some amazing years ahead of you here with people you haven‚Äôt met yet.

4123,2024-08-23 15:56:25,77,"Try to separate the desire to make friends from the anxiety about seeing friend groups rapidly coalesce. Some people get lucky and find their lasting friend groups immediately; many don‚Äôt. Lots of connections form under the pressure to be part of a group and then fall apart as people start finding more meaningful friendships. 

Focus on the people who seem interesting to you, whether or not they‚Äôre already part of a group. If already having friends makes them exclude you, then you‚Äôre better off without them. But you‚Äôll seem less weird than you fear ‚Äî everyone is just trying to get to know other people, and there‚Äôs no set pace at which it‚Äôs supposed to happen.

As others have suggested, go to lots of stuff. You‚Äôll always see people who don‚Äôt already have someone to talk to.

Sometimes you gotta understand that opportunities don‚Äôt come to you, rather they want you to come to them.

Sure, some people will say no and that‚Äôs okay, but as classes and RSOs come back to life, you will meet so many people it might seem like you have too many friends. In general, people are a lot more open because there are so many people in your exact situation - a new environment and the fear of not making friends. I am an OOS student myself and I was homesick for the first 2-3 weeks. I missed having friends I could fall back on and could only now call them once a week at most.

On quad day, go for any club that even remotely interests you, talk to upperclassmen and ask them for advice, they would be glad to help or even hang out as long as you are nice. club sports is also an option, as well as finding people who like similar music or activities as you (gaming, etc.)

4223,2024-08-23 04:58:21,0,"That's the theory.   In practice, they seem to be designed so that someone with impaired hearing will notice them at a considerable distance.   Central C-U has a high density of sirens and very few buildings capable of blocking the sound enough that a younger person won't hear them.    Most people in town can hear the sirens unless they are already in a basement.

Backup matters a lot more if you are out in a rural area, and especially if you are hard of hearing.   And for the less common night events if you are a heavy sleeper.

The cell phone warnings seem to be the primary backup these days.   It's easier to tune the settings than a NOAA radio, so that you get only important warnings.  Many people react to being woken up by junk warnings (out of area, amber alerts, etc) by disabling the warnings entirely.   Also, most younger folks are surgically connected to their phone, but no one carries their NOAA radio to class or on a trip.

All of the cell phone warnings are super loud.    You can select which warnings to receive, but the ones you allow bypass all sorts of loudness and ""do not disturb"" settings.    They aren't quite as bad as some NOAA radios, but those will reliably wake the dead.",margaretmfleck,1

The reason why storms seem to miss cities is that cities are a very small bullseye for severe weather, all things considered. Strong storms of the type to form strong tornadoes generally do not cluster next to each other--there are usually gaps of a hundred or so miles, as they would otherwise compete with each other for moisture. A city is very small target to hit.

Weak tornadoes from linear storms are actually far more common than you think, and sadly often unwarned due to lack of predictability. One of my old ATMS professors told me about the time a tornado went down her street in the middle of the night in Champaign in 2018(?), and she had no idea until she woke up and saw broken branches lying in a rotated pattern.",ok_boomeruiuc,2

The upside of the compact housing is that it is in a convenient location and comes with meals, easy ways to meet people, a cleaning service for common areas, and other folks who will notice if you are melting down.    It's much harder for campus to manage the situation when a student melts down off campus, because they may not find out until they are in major trouble and the dean's office may have no way to find out where they are living.   The social cost of dealing with these failures is vastly higher than the cost of students putting up with dorm food and a roommate for a year.

The dean's office does also try to help the off-campus students.   However, that's inherently much harder.

Senate Bill 1289 creates regulations and standards for carbon dioxide sequestration.  CO2 sequestration is a process that was developed in the 1970s, which is increasingly being used by utility companies and governments to bury excess CO2 from power generation in underground geologic formations, rather than release the CO2 into the atmosphere.

CO2 capture and storage is considered by many to be a key tool that in the fight against global warming/climate change.  But pumping CO2 into underground formations carries risks of course, which is why governments all over the world are working to come up with regulatory frameworks to keep it safe. One of the main risks is that underground pipelines used during the pumping process could rupture and release CO2 into groundwater supplies, which would change the water chemistry and release toxic minerals such as mercury into the water.",bestadvices,6

There is no overnight parking during the week anywhere on campus (without a proper permit). E14 and F23 only have overnight parking on weekends. You will not find parking near Sherman without a permit (if there are even permits still available). You'd have to find free street parking off campus and bus back. Just make sure you move the car every couple days. Good luck!",illstillglow,1

This sounds like there is a central modem for the building, meaning you do not need to bring or purchase your own

Also be sure that when buying a router you get one that is *not* a combo modem/router",SierraPapaHotel,6
