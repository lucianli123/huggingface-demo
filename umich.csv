All these questions are answered in the lease you signed. We don't know the specific terms of your lease. You might have a clause blocking sub-leases or not. We don't know.

The reservation is for getting a list of people to replace the tenant when they leave. You essentially can't get a unit unless you sign these reservations because it goes to the first person on the reservations. It's very common now.

I feel your struggles as a fellow transfer student and then some (Junior, 33M). At my age, I'm treated like a ghost, and everyone else has gotten to live together and take their gen-ed courses together. For transfers, we just kind of get thrust into the mix like a cold call, and it's hard to melt in. It feels awful to start a course, and it seems like the whole room has been talking and getting to know each other long before you walked in. I never had this issue in community college. Everyone was very inclusive and accommodating in CC. Every class I had, it was extremely easy to make new friends.

Anyway, if you put yourself out there, you will find your people. I know it's challenging if you're shy, but it's the only way you'll make solid connections. I'm a true introvert and get exhausted quickly in large groups from stimulus overload, but I try to push through it and shake it off with a smile, or step into the restroom for a minute to recharge and refocus.

I'd recommend stopping by the TSCs at different colleges. LSA has a great TSC, and even if it's not your home college, everyone in the lounge is super friendly and ready to meet you. They can also help you find ways to connect with others! I've heard the TSC at the COE is also very good.

I'm in the transfer connections program, and they host monthly events that pit you in social settings with other students. They play games and give out free food and prizes. It's really cool and just one of many resources. I went for the first time today and found my first friend!

Counseling can also help. Not just for talking about your problems but for finding social resources. People having issues making friends is counseling's most common reason for being approached.

If you step out of your comfort zone and start putting yourself at social events, you'll eventually find your people. The organizers know how to work these events and will create an atmosphere that makes you feel comfortable enough to connect with others. It's good that you're joining clubs and school events. I think you'll be quite surprised by who you might meet when you start attending these functions!

If you ever want someone to talk to, I'm always available to meet up and chitchat. Our age difference is quite vast, but I'm sure we have plenty we could learn from each other!

243,2024-09-03 19:03:18,79,"Zionism can be broken into two major buckets, political and spiritual. 

Political Zionism in its most simplistic form means Jews should have the right to self determination. It does not say how that should be accomplished. There are multiple subsets/parties within political zionism that outline ideologies on how to do that, just like there are multiple subsets/political parties within American democracy that outline how different groups think America should be run. Lumping all political zionists together as one monolithic group makes as much sense as saying all Americans have the same politics and aims. To say point blank that it‚Äôs ok to want any or all Zionist politicians/soldiers dead is just as nuts as saying it‚Äôs ok to want any or all American politicians/soldiers dead. Also, a two state solution would be a Zionist stance. 

Spiritual Zionism is part of Judaism because Judaism, the ethnoreligion, does not exist without the concept of Israel. Jews are a tribal people who originated from Israel and their religious practice is very much tied to the land. They pray facing Israel, their prayers are about Israel, their holidays incorporate plants indigenous to Israel and/or celebrate being in Israel/trying to get to Israel/defending Israel. Furthermore, Hebrew is part of Jewish culture (Jews use their Hebrew names in marriage certificates/ketubahs etc.) Spiritual Zionism is very much intertwined with the Jewish ethnic identity, and to stop being spiritually Zionist is to stop being Jewish. Spiritual Zionism has nothing to do with politics. I‚Äôd argue actually that the majority of American Jews know very little about political Zionism and historically haven‚Äôt paid much attention to the inner workings of a country half way around the world, but when they hear ‚ÄúZionist‚Äù they automatically think ‚ÄúJew‚Äù because of spiritual Zionism. 

The tldr: To say zionism is only a political movement, and one with only nefarious and specific/rigid ideologies is disingenuous as best and erasure at worst. I think a major obstacle to productive dialogue is the lack of knowledge surrounding Jewish identity by non-Jews.",Early_Most9575,6

In 1899 before israel was created the zionist conference's stated goal was to colonize Palestine.  Here's an article on it, might be able to find the full copy somewhere else 

https://www.nytimes.com/1899/06/20/archives/conference-of-zionists-elect-delegates-at-their-meeting-in.html

For the vast majority, when protesters refers to zionists they are referring to this original definition of people who want to create a mono jewish ethnostate founded on evicting non jewish palestinians from their holy land.  This is necessarily  still a useful, likely is the best definition because it is the definition used by Netanyahu, Ben Gvir, and the Likud party.  As recently as this week they have shown maps showing their plans to seize the entire west bank for permanent Israeli settlement in full, and their language towards gaza has been of how to evict them so that israeli settlers can begin moving in.  That is practical, actual, in effect, real zionism in action.  That is what protesters are specifically talking about.  If we are attempting to be most understanding, a sticker like in the OP would be referring to the zionist soldiers who maybe killed a family member of theirs during one of the many mass evictions, much in the way a colonial american might have said ""Death to Redcoats!"".  Of course, too many people also use the phrase to mean ""average person who supports zionism but isnt actually firing the guns or passing the laws"" which is a problem, our whole goal in this discussion is to think how best we can get to a scenario where apartheid is over and civilians can live in peace regardless of their prior beliefs.  But you also have to be wary of tone policing revolutionary fervor when there is actual blood spilled, especially when we are american and really shouldnt be choosing a winner in the fight of who gets to evict who, we should be working towards a solution that evicts nobody.

If US people want to redefine the term to ""people who want the jews to be able to live in that specific area in some capacity because of their common heritage"" then you can do so on your own, just know you are now using it differently than the protesters so getting mad at them for using a different definition than you doesnt make any sense.  Speak to people in the language they use.  If you want protesters to stop using the word zionist to describe people like Netanyahu, then you should be able to provide an alternate clear, efficient, and accurate term for them to use instead, otherwise they will use the same term in the same way its been used since 1899 when the zionists themselves called the region palestine",PvtJet07,1

266,2024-09-03 19:03:18,79,"You referenced the Likud party, which represents a specific strand of Zionism - one that I don‚Äôt personally agree with nor do the majority of Israelis. Before 10/7, there were months of protests including strikes against Bibi and his government. Those strikes are against a political party within Zionism though, not the existence of Israel or Zionism itself.

Similarly, there have been massive ceasefire protests in Israel following Hamas‚Äô recent execution of 6 hostages including one American citizen. Again, these are against bibi‚Äôs government which represents a particular implementation of Zionism, not the existence of Israel/zionism itself. 

I‚Äôm not going to attempt to justify some of Bibi‚Äôs comments or those of some in his party as they have not been justifiable. I will say that the Israeli government is a robust - though flawed - democracy that is on par with America‚Äôs, and the crazy comments of a political leader do not necessarily represent the whole nor do they reflect the actual power the person in charge has to act on those words. There are real checks and balances there despite Bibi‚Äôs recent attempts to change the Supreme Court to remove them. 

Also, FWIW, removing Palestinians from Gaza is EXTREMELY unpopular policy and it will not happen. No sane person wants that, that is batshit crazy policy. Handling a withdrawal from areas B/C in the West Bank will be a difficult policy issue as the complete removal of Jews/israelis from Gaza (including Jewish cemeteries) in 2005 caused a vacuum leading to Hamas‚Äô election. There‚Äôs genuine fear Hamas will gain control in the WB if the occupation unilaterally pulls out without a plan, so that will take time even if it‚Äôs the right thing to do. There is a strong bloc of Israelis who want that and advocate for it. 

Linking to a definition from 1899 doesn‚Äôt seem particularly useful to me as that is not the same definition in use today. It is normal for definitions to change with time (Republicans love talking about how they were the party of Lincoln despite the modern Republican party aligning more with the Democratic Party of that era), and by 1949, political zionism shifted considerably. Modern Israel was formed not as an ethnostate, but as a multicultural and mostly secular state with the state religion being Judaism. It‚Äôs similar to any European Christian country with a state church but one that also has a diverse population and allows anyone to serve in government/have any occupation independent of religion or ethnic background. Israel is actually the most religiously diverse country in the region, despite ~70% being Jewish. That composition is not consistent with an ethnostate, which would be something like Japan, China, or even the population of Gaza which is >98% Sunni Muslim. The historian Benny Morris does a really good job explaining this and I highly recommend his work. He spent his early career documenting Israeli war crimes and explaining what happened during the creation of Israel. 


My definitions of spiritual vs political Zionism are not my own nor are they an American invention. Spiritual Zionism is as old as Judaism. How I defined political Zionism was the accepted modern definition of political Zionism. Both of these terms are Jewish concepts defined by Jews for Jews. It is not the non-Jewish community‚Äôs place to redefine this to suit a political agenda. Talking over Jews and ignoring them won‚Äôt help us solve this issue. 

Finally, how the larger community talks about Israel affects Jews everywhere. Last Friday, two Jewish Pitt students were attacked: https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/pittsburgh/news/jewish-students-attacked-university-of-pittsburgh/

This was on the heels of Columbia releasing its antisemitism report detailing absolutely terrible treatment of its Jewish community: https://president.columbia.edu/content/report-2-task-force-antisemitism

277,2024-09-03 19:03:18,79,"Again, despite your downvote, I am telling you that you are using the word zionism to mean something different than the protesters, so thinking they are in the wrong for using it is pointless.  They are protesting against the Bibi brand zionism which is currently in charge in Israel.  Just because you use it for many things does not mean they are using it for those things, they are using it in the way they mean it - against the political ideology of a settler ethnostate. 

I know there are protests against him.  I was very happy to see them, even if I know those protests are more against him than they are pro palestinian civilian.  But Bibi still won an election and his brand of Zionism is currently guiding israeli policy, from well before Oct 7 whether it was denying farming or well grants to palestinian settlements or restricting travel, to west bank settlements, to banning imported goods to Gaza, to sniping an american journalist and blaming it on Hamas until enough people called them out. Multiple pro palestinian americans have been killed by Israel.  No policy has changed as a result. 

There were also protests recently FOR Bibi too, when the soldiers raping people to death at Sde Taiman were attempted to be punished (and now do the rounds on Istaeli TV instead of being in jail) - Bibi brand zionism is in full control of the military.

Your brand of zionism may be different than his.  But it is his that comes from the original usage in 1899 and it is his that is tangibly guiding military movements today and his that is currently sending bulldozers to the west bank to flatten Jenin, and it is his that protesters condemn when they chant against zionism.  I ask that you understand that it is more important to know what someone means by the word than to get hung up on the word itself.

I fully understand this is all a problem for jewish people who wish for coexistence.  Bibi is attempting to conflate his version of zionism with all zionism and further with all judaism such that he and his supporters can call anyone who criticizes him antisemitic, that if you ask him to stop killing children he can say you hate jews.  It is their stated goal and why they are pushing so hard to redefine words in their favor.  There is a reason Israel is the only foreign nation where US states will pass laws banning people from NOT working with them.  Bibi's brand wants to conflate political ideology with ethnicity and religion until they are inextricable. The tangible effect of that also goes in reverse, now anti jewish racists of both the classic nazi variety and also the modern anti israel variety attack random jewish people because they see them as representative of bibi brand zionism even though they are not - which is complicated when Bibi's brand of zionism will claim that they are.  Conflating an ethnicity with a political state is one of the most racist things you can do and Bibi brand zionism does it to itself. Arabs and sikhs in the US are well aware of this post 9/11 when they were all seen as Al Qaeda terrorists by large amounts of the country, we have a decade of weirdly racist TV shows as a result.

As a result of bibi's influence, now they have convinced places like colleges all around the country that they need to treat any student who says ""free palestine"" as antisemitic lest they themselves as a university be seen as antisemitic.  I regularly see social media posts where someone is pinging a business, like an airline, trying to get a flight attendant wearing a palestinian flag pin fired for being antisemitic, some airlines have even bent to that pressure. It's a horrifying loop that US liberals are engaging in that plays directly into the hands of Bibi brand zionism and strengthens it, not weakens it.

So again.  If there is a word or phrase two different groups use differently.  You can't judge them for saying the word using your definition when they are using it for their definition.  Rather than fight over the semantics of what words are and aren't allowed at a protest, perhaps a better option is to actually engage with the protesters and what their goals are.    At this point 8/10 democrats want to stop sending weapons to Israel, I believe it may even be a majority of americans total.  Not because they are antisemitic, not because they support hamas, but because Bibi brand zionism is genocidal, and he is using the lives of jewish people who are not his brand of zionism as a shield to protect himself, and the protest movement wants him to stop and just like the protesters in tel aviv who got skunk gassed, they want a ceasefire now.  Bibi does not want a ceasefire.  Nobody has any leverage over him except Biden and american businesses.  So it is our job to find a way to make that pressure effective.  And tone policing antiwar protests rather than, you know, joining them until the war stops, is not going to be effective.",PvtJet07,2

Depends on the specific ceasefire, a lot of the leadership of TAHRIR won't disavow Hamas, which makes a long term ceasefire impossible. Based on many of their statements, I also believe they (TAHRIR's leadership) wouldn't want a ceasefire if the military capabilities were flipped.

>  If you don't want to support anyone dying why are you unwilling to join the ceasefire protesters?

I don't want anyone to die, but that isn't what I said. I said calling for people's death is bad. If someone tries to kill you and the only practical response to saving your life or limb (or of someone else's) is to kill your attacker. I don't think you should punish someone for defending themselves, but its still bad that someone had to die. But its worse to not stop the attacker. This is what most people think and I don't think you are genuine in your response and it seems like you are just trying to create some untrue narrative.

Are you, the resident anti calls for death for any reason person on campus, against joining a call for ALL fighting to stop and us to stop spending tax dollars on bombs that lead to more fighting?

You are saying someone is allowed to kill their attacker in self defense, but you refusal to join the ceasefire protests means you think Israel killing 20,000 plus women and children, poisoning their water supply until Polio came back, destroying their desalination plants, bombing their hospitals, flattening upwards of 60% of all residential buildings, blocking food aid trucks coming in, killing UN aid workers who are bringing in food, etc - counts as ""defending yourself"" and also that anyone who fights back against all of the above is not ""defending themself"".  I somehow question those dead children were an active threat to the soldier's life who sniped them while they walked down the street.  In that sense, under your logic, if you are allowed to kill someone who is killing you, are Palestinians not allowed to kill Israeli invaders?  If your 10 year old son was sniped in the chest, are you allowed to call for the death of the sniper? It seems you are, because you are calling for the death of Hamas people who did Oct 7, right?

People aren't calling for a ceasefire for israel to stop killing hamas soldiers.  They are calling for a ceasefire to stop killing innocent civilians by bomb, disease, and famine while using bulldozers to level the areas for future settlements to be built.

I am unclear how your desire for Hamas surrendering has anything to do with a sniper shooting a child or a US made bomb being dropped on a refugee camp or all desalination plants being seen as a military facilities.  Those are all actions taken by Israeli soldiers.  What danger did that desalination plant server to the average citizen in Tel Aviv?  Was there a Hamas base under every single one of the tens of thousands of homes that are now rubble due to bombs?  We've dropped more tons of explosives on Gaza at this point than Horishima and Nagasaki to kill a resistance group with no standing army that recruits from teenagers who have only known life in the world's largest racial ghetto.  Is that ""self defense against an attacker?""

I question how someone who has such a clear, succinct, and simple worldview of ""its evil to say anyone should die, i am against the death penalty"" can clearly and accurately state that Hamas has done crimes and must be defended against.  But cannot commit to joining a ceasefire movement because they disagreee with some of the people in it and the most they can say about Israel, who by the numbers has currently done upwards of 40 October 7ths worth of attacks not counting the billions of dollars in destroyed infrastructure, is ""if the IDF has done a war crime they should be punished"".  A passive response that gives no responsibility to anyone, compared to Hamas, who you condemned in very clear terms.

They have. Going solely by the death toll of people they could actively identify by name, if you consider Oct 7 1 war crime Israel has done 40 war crimes.  That's why there are protests.  Your strong ethical rhetoric does not match your actual convictions and that's why I pushed back on you.

I said I supported one in general. But also understand that is unlikely to happen or last due to Hamas.

> A majority of americans currently support an arms embargo of offensive weapons to Israel as a tangible way to make that ceasefire happen.

Depends on how the polling question is asked.

>  the resident anti calls for death

Hey you got it right this time.

> against joining a call for ALL fighting to stop

One can fight and not wish to engage in death (I am veteran so I understand this quite well).

> You are saying someone is allowed to kill their attacker in self defense

If that is the only reasonable method (given context) to save life and limb. 

> but you refusal to join the ceasefire protests

The specific protests on campus I find to be disingenuous and their leadership supporting terrorism. I also don't support their ceasefire terms. I do 100% support a ceasefire where Hamas lays down their arms and surrenders. The only realistic path to reducing death is the surrender of Hamas.

> Israel killing 20,000 plus women and children

Despite the numbers being highly disputed, most of the civilian deaths arise from Hamas using civilians as human shields. Having actual experience to understand combat and the fog of war, I know how nearly impossible is it to engage with Hamas and not accidentally kill civilians (which is tragic). This is mostly due to Hamas wanting that to happen because it helps their propaganda campaign abroad.

> poisoning their water supply until Polio came back,

Misinformation. Also there was a targeted agreed ceasefire to bring in aid workers specifically for dealing with Polio recently.

> destroying their desalination plants, bombing their hospitals, flattening upwards of 60% of all residential buildings,

Mostly because Hamas was intentionally fighting from those structures, so when the IDF attacks, they claim a propaganda win.

> blocking food aid trucks coming in

I agree Israel should stop the people blocking the aid trucks and the IDF should work to make sure Hamas doesn't hoard the supplies.

> killing UN aid workers 

Clearly a mistake due to the fog of war. The IDF has accidentally killed other IDF personnel due to communications issues. Happened to units I know in the USA as well. War is incredibly dynamic and chaotic. 

The rest of your semi-specific instances are a mix of misinformation or the result of Hamas using civilians as shields. Regardless I support an investigation into credible war crimes.",_iQlusion,1

I won't even bother linking you the source of all the ""misinformation"" I mentioned because you clearly don't care even if I put a news article with video and satellite image of the destroyed building in front of your face.  We'll just move on.

I wonder regarding this human shields thing you are hung up on (which israel does too by the way, they have palestinians open doors for them as a way to check for traps/go in first, they've done it both in Gaza and are currently doing it in Jenin in the West Bank - the IDF also has bases in city centers too, they have tunnels, etc.  same as Hamas).  Leads me to two questions I'm REALLY curious about.

1). Do you really think if I pull up a map of every single apartment building and house in Gaza that is now rubble, which is basically all of them, do you think there was a Hamas militant standing in each and every one the moment the missile hit?  Spread out evenly?  And if so, is it normal military tactics if there are less than a dozen dudes with small arms (being generous, maybe they kept moving between them and Israel just kept missing them over and over) in an apartment building full of 30+ people - to destroy the building and kill everyone inside.  2:1 tradeoff of civilians to militants a normal trade the american military would make?

In that sense, when you breach a building.  Do you still do the training where you practice not shooting civilians and only shooting terrorists?  Or because bombing an entire building of mixed combatants and noncombatants is now accepted policy, when you breach a building do you just shoot anything that moves on sight?  Since you are allowed to kill roughly 1-2 civilians for every dead soldier per Israeli targeting policy?

Here's some images of northern gaza for reference - can you confirm every single one of those buildings was a Hamas base?

https://www.euronews.com/2023/10/27/northern-gaza-reduced-to-rubble-satellite-images-show-before-and-after-air-strikes

2) you're a veteran so you know rules of engagement very well.  If a terrorist group in the united states took a school full of children hostage, locked them in the basement, demanded a prisoner exchange to free the kids.  Since under your logic above if someone is using human shields its ok to kill the human shields as long as you kill the terrorists too.  You would have no problem with the american military if they dropped a bomb on that school and killed every terrorist and also every child inside?  You know, same as they do in Gaza?

Disingenuous much? Either that or your comprehension skills are terrible (explains why you washed out of both CS and ROTC).

> I mentioned because you clearly don't care even if I put a news article with video and satellite image of the destroyed building in front of your face

I know many buildings are destroyed. Its mostly because Hamas was fighting from those buildings.

> which israel does too by the way, they have palestinians open doors for them as a way to check for traps/go in first

Proof please :). 

> Do you really think if I pull up a map of every single apartment building and house in Gaza that is now rubble, which is basically all of them, do you think there was a Hamas militant standing in each and every one the moment the missile hit? 

No because Hamas, usually fires and moves. Creating unfortunate situation where the building is hit after they have left. I wish the IDF had superpowers to see the exact position of every Hamas fighter, but its not practical. Unfortunately ever civilian building Hamas operates out of becomes viable target.

> And if so, is it normal military tactics if there are less than a dozen dudes with small arms (being generous, maybe they kept moving between them and Israel just kept missing them over and over) in an apartment building full of 30+ people

Often the IDF tells civilians to leave areas. The IDF doesn't know the exact occupants of each building. They just know enemy fire came from the building, which makes it a viable target. The real question is why Hamas firing from buildings with civilians. Its because they want the IDF to accidentally kill them for propaganda. Hamas has openly admitted this a few times as their strategy.

> Do you still do the training where you practice not shooting civilians and only shooting terrorists. 

Man you would know if you didn't wash out of ROTC.

>  Or because bombing an entire building of mixed combatants and noncombatants is now accepted policy.

I wish the IDF didn't rely so much on bombing but its also one of the worst places to breach in-person and I also don't have the intel on the ground. The IDF is also an army with lots conscripts, so their skill wise is terrible. Its like sending your mom to breach a building, after she did her flimsy training like 12 years ago. She has to breach a building where Hamas is intentionally mixing in civilians. A lot of civilians are going to get killed due to people not suited for combat and intense adrenaline. Still should prosecute them if they accidentally shoot a non-combatant. But if Hamas didn't intentionally use civilians as cover, this wouldn't be an issue.

> Here's some images of northern gaza for reference - can you confirm every single one of those buildings was a Hamas base?

Can you confirm they were not? Has the onus of war ever required putting together a 20 page dossier per trigger pull?

>  you're a veteran so you know rules of engagement very well. If a terrorist group in the united states took a school full of children hostage, locked them in the basement, demanded a prisoner exchange to free the kids. Since under your logic above if someone is using human shields its ok to kill the human shields as long as you kill the terrorists too. 

Domestically it wouldn't be the military for one. Two, I don't support prisoner exchanges in most instances as it incentives people to take more prisoners. Three, I would imagine in your scenario, there isn't thousands of other terrorist fighting in adjacent areas, spreading my resources thin. Or them creating a fog of war since its an isolated incident. Which in this scenario, you have more resources to plan more appropriately, where the calculus to breach and try a targeted rescue is easier. Bombing is only useful in war conditions, not in 1 off incidents. Although depending how well fortified the terrorist are, it can be extremely difficult to not cause collateral damage in the rescue attempt. Might require some creativity. The Russians tried sleeping gas once and it didn't go well. 

Your scenario is dumb because it doesn't account for war conditions (which you don't know since you washed out).",_iQlusion,1

338,2024-09-03 16:27:13,2,"Feels like it's mostly about how much your time is worth. Getting an orange pass could possibly save you about 10-15 minutes each way because of a more direct, shorter and frequent bus route. This is nicer in the winter semester than now. The close lots fill up quicker but the further that are still on the blue routes will have spots. You'll appreciate it more when it gets colder in the winter than now.

Buses stop at the orange lots so if you plan ahead, you'll be fine. But some lots fill fast - especially those by north campus.

I used the forest avenue parking garage today and somehow lost my ticket. That little screwup made my 2 hour parking time skyrocket to $36. That alone made the orange pass extremely valuable. But even if that didn't happen, $3 for a class session of parking every day adds up.

So I know from multiple perspectives that people can be friends and have stuff in common across generations.

Like, tell your classmates how you saw Shrek in theaters or played Elder Scrolls Morrowind when it first got released. There's things like that that are sorta timeless, and a lot of zoomers are genuinely fans of and are interested in. Like just have fun with it. ""when I was a kid my computer mouse had a BALL inside it and we had to pop it out and clean it sometimes"", like idk, some ppl get a kick out of an older perspective. Some kids will also feel more comfortable confiding in you because you're older, it's nice!

My advice for this class is to take advantage of the tutoring provided for the course (https://ecas.engin.umich.edu/elc/tutoring/) I used it to better understand the material and getting ready for the exams. Office hours are mainly imo just for the Hws. I would recommend making a group with people you know or other people in the class. Going to OH where it‚Äôs convenient for y‚Äôall and split up the questions to later solve with the TAs in OH.

So to sum up: 
- get a group to solve the HWs in OHs
- go to tutoring to actually learn the material and get ready for the exams

606,2024-09-01 01:38:18,4,"The biggest thing is repetition. Repetition is super important in memorizing and absorbing material. The course is designed to give you repetition of the material in different ways. So doing the readings, going to lecture, going to discussion, and doing the HW. That gives you the opportunity to learn and practice the material 4x.

The other most important thing I can stress is, do not jump to the answer key immediately. It is super common where bright kids will get stuck, jump to the answer key and say oh that makes sense and move on. That is akin to being the passenger in a car, you can see how the driver got you from point A to B but you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be able to do it yourself in the driver seat. 

Finally, if you are able to teach the material you know you have mastered it. Always try to volunteer to explain problems or things in class or when studying with peers. Try try try to teach.

664,2024-08-31 14:32:05,515,"In short, it depends on whether an event (put on by student organizers) is going on and the protest disrupts the event.

A random preacher without a bullhorn isn‚Äôt considered disruptive because they aren‚Äôt stopping folks from attending something else (regardless of if they are making folks feel uncomfy). Students are well within their rights to go up beside these folks and straight up fact-check them in real time, comment loudly or whatever, because they weren‚Äôt invited to campus.

On the other hand, when folks are invited to campus by some students and others either physically block (e.g., restricting people walking around as per fire code) or verbally block (i.e. speaking over a person or chanting) the message or event of the invited party, that‚Äôs when folks are told/made to stop. Also, there are usually two stages of verbal warnings before arrests happen (first it‚Äôs ‚Äúhey you‚Äôre disrupting the event, please stop‚Äù and then ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt stop, DPSS will step in‚Äù, followed by DPSS).

Basically it comes down to ‚Äúif students invite someone to be here, UofM as a public institution cannot say no based on their content‚Äù even if the content is abhorrent. Are those students who invited someone abhorrent above criticism by their peers? Not at all! But are they protected to bring in someone to hear their message without interruption? Yes.

666,2024-08-31 14:32:05,515,"> Surely screaming slurs and hate on a megaphone is more disruptive and harmful to our campus, right?

Courts have long decided you can say pretty much anything. Verbal speech in itself is not considered disruptive in most cases no matter what the content is. Its only when your verbal speech makes it impossible for others to hear like a speaker at an event. 

Screaming slurs on the diag when there are no scheduled events is 100% not considered disruptive by the courts and is legally protected.

> Are only students required to abide by the new limitations passed by the regents?

Only students and staff can be sanctioned under the university's internal processes. Everyone has to follow the university rules when on campus property, but if you are unaffiliated expect to get trespassed for violating the rules.

Let this be clear, the protestors could have literally done their die-in on the grass and there would have been practically nothing the university could have done. 

Moral of the story, conduct your protests under the rules of the University. If you think those rules are non-just or illegal, feel free to get arrested and do your best to overturn the rules/laws.

And the argument that it emotionally prevents it is not legally sound.

If the people organizing Palestine protests want the same protections, they have to play by the rules, which means not physically obstructing buildings that others pay to attend.

I guarantee that if a group of these ‚Äúpreacher‚Äù jerk offs blocked the school they would be hauled off too.

TLDR: if you protest in a federally protected way, a federally funded school and local PD can do nothing to stop it. Game the system the same way they do.

If you have things on a sign you‚Äôre holding up, you could be asked to move to not obstruct someone‚Äôs view, but that will not get you thrown out unless carrying any signs has been noted as against the time/place/manner restrictions beforehand. An example of that is like at graduation you could be told you can‚Äôt have any flags (which means neither a USA one, nor another country, nor one with a block M or Go Blue).",jon_snow_phd,6

Many faculty have admin positions, such as department chairs as well as college deans, that engage in the every-day running of the university you are describing. I can personally attest that I have heard some of them discuss views that are extremely discriminatory towards Israeli students. 

You are inventing conspiracies with little actual evidence.

Edit: Let me give you an example of a case I was privy to last year. Palestinian student singles out an Israeli student in class, points at him and says he and his family are colonizers and should not be here. Israeli student goes to the chair that that is inappropriate, discriminatory and potentially hateful/violent speech. Chair responded that it is the student‚Äôs academic freedom to engage in that behavior in the classroom. Bad call from the chair.

There are many lawsuits for discrimination waiting to happen, or currently being prepared, that you‚Äôre not aware of, simply because you don‚Äôt seem to be someone in the position to know. 

Anyone who did what those students did on the diag would be arrested. It was not about their views. The university last year was perfectly happy to let TAHRIR protest - with big smiles on their faces and signs saying ‚Äúdown with Israel‚Äù - a gathering on the diag in remembrance of the Israeli kidnapping victims.

Faculty - yes, there‚Äôs SACUA and other governing committees. Students - CSG should in principle consult the president about student and campus life (seems so far they just try to make life on campus harder for students, but that‚Äôs a separate discussion).

There are opportunities to have a say, and if you're passionate about it I encourage you to attend relevant town halls, answer surveys, join advisory boards, get involved in CSG, and address Regents in public commentary periods.  You and your interest would be welcome, you will find a cadre of peers with similar interests but I don't they'll be typical of the student body here.

He also references that the non student protestors were not fearful of punishment from the school since they have no relationship with the school. This part references most likely the financial relationship students have with the school. 

Lastly he references the regents ‚Äúfinally taking action‚Äù which implies that either no action or not enough action was taken during the occupation of previously stated protestors.

909,2024-08-30 16:25:25,33,"It passed but it goes to the President to be signed or vetoed. Since Alifa Chowdhury is part of the shut-it-down nonsense, she is likely to veto it like before. After the veto, CSG can re-vote on the issue at the next meeting. The budget will need 2/3rds of votes to override the veto. Luckily since 25 is over 2/3rds it is likely to override the veto at the next CSG meeting. So it's looking like shut it down has failed (mostly because their members were too lazy to attend meetings and got replaced).

I watched the CSG meeting live and it was quite sickening to hear how shut it down members kept trying to frame not giving funds to student org as something good for students. 

Also, shut it down member Danah Owaida seems to support violent protests on campus as she stated ""there's nothing wrong with non-peaceful protests"". It also looks like CSG is not being true in the meeting minutes they released because that statement from her was omitted. I pointed out the comment from her on the Zoom stream, which they lock down, however you can still use the Q&A feature. I made a question (via the Q&A) pointing out the violent rhetoric from Owaida and one of the CSG members responded to the question. I snapped a screen-cap luckily, since they removed her comment from the meeting minutes.

It looks like CSG is not being honest in their meeting minutes and I call on them to release all their Zoom recordings, so we can independently verify the legitimacy of the meeting minutes. So they can't intentionally omit things from the meeting minutes.",_iQlusion,28

The university has always allowed its rules to be broken regularly without a violent police response, letting all sorts of people hang out all over its land and take up space. They‚Äôve been inventing new rules all through the past year to specifically criminalize these protests.

It was a political decision to begin enforcing previously unenforced rules, a political decision to invent new rules, a political decision to target pro-Palestine protesters and ignore pro-Israel ones, and a political decision to use significant force in this selective enforcement.

The students were entirely peaceful, did not mess with any of the club‚Äôs tables and allowed people to walk around them easily, and even this was too much for the University, which sent students to the hospital or to jail.

Governments don‚Äôt take away your right to protest by just banning all protests. They narrow the space in which protest can take place, more and more, and brutalize their opposition to deter any  political activity. They selectively enforce and enacted theoretically unbiased rules to wield political power.

Even if you don‚Äôt care about Gaza, you should care that a campaign of violent political repression is being waged against students at your university. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt have an issue with this is deluded or an authoritarian.",Significant_Stay1337,229
1054,2024-08-30 01:21:37,79,"real talk from a nonbiased bystander to this entire thing; it's not to feel a sense of deep disgust at those counter-demonstrators with Israeli and American flags that were jeering with carnival grins as they watched protestors, who were saying names of the children killed in airstrikes or numbers of wounded children without surviving families, getting roughed up by the cops, waving their flags and laughing like it's a surreal comedy instead of the reality we all inhabit. to stand by from the other side of the street and watch all of that in the distance as i was, it's impossible not to feel a sense of complicity in something vast and truly awful. i bought a maple-nut donut from washtenaw dairy and fed crumbs of it to the squirrels afterwards to fill that pit, but that feeling can't be eaten over.

edit: i seem to have narrows down the source for that feeling, one of my friends was in that crowd standing around and jeering. the fact that i know him in every other way as a good person who volunteers for things like food gatherers and feeds squirrels donuts, has compassion for everyone just like me, yet thought to include me in a fundraiser email for the then-sanctioned 97th battalion, just¬†devoid of that compassion when compassion is the only humane course, that contradiction makes me sick to my stomach. the fact that we share so much in this world with people that can be like that, people who are good in every way except one horrific aspect yet we can and probably will simply brush that off, that is a contradiction not easily amended. I‚Äôm not going to ever bring this up to my friend, I‚Äôm Hindu and he‚Äôs Jewish, we‚Äôre both agnostic and I know better than to bring up issues like this nowadays to others, but i don‚Äôt think I can really think of him the same way after this. for the fact that I lack the spine to do what those that laid down did and raise this obvious contradiction to a person who thinks that i think like him, i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to look in the mirror the same way either. i‚Äôm don‚Äôt intend to be an impolite ass and ghost our lunch tomorrow, but if this sick feeling won‚Äôt go away by tomorrow morning, then i‚Äôm calling it off due to a stomach flu.",sud_int,95

The campus-wide Palestinian resistance movement had been growing for some time, and having received word of their impending Diag protest, the Zionist knew they had to act. This was their territory, and they would make that known. Just past the stroke of noon, a group of pro-Israel student militants led by Ron Weiser himself made their way to the Block M. They were at least two thousand in number, the blood of slaughtered children dripping from their uniforms as banners emblazoned with the Star of David flew overhead. But the protesters were not deterred. All 20 members of the TAHRIR coalition charged forward, flanked by their GEO allies. They threw watermelon slices at their foes until enough space had been cleared for a knitting circle. ‚ÄúHey, hey, ho, ho - genocide must go!‚Äù they chanted, sitting down with their yarn. In that moment, Weiser knew he had met his match. The Zionists laid down their arms and listened intently as the members of the resistance conducted a slam poetry session on the evils of colonialism. The campus was secure, the day won.

1075,2024-08-30 01:21:37,79,"Since you seem to be tracking, can you say more about how many new rules were created last year?

Here is my take on what looks like swifter action:  Last year, being lax about enforcement of rules was strategic in some ways (it's always good to have a little latitude when you're dealing with students) but it also had some costs.  For example, things escalated and protestors tried some new tactics that got Regents upset and, in some cases, afraid.  The University also came under criticism and pressure from outside stakeholders.  On top of that, the Title VI investigation and settlement.  And then news nationally that activists were gearing up to do more this year.  So there are lot of reasons to explain why an institution that sometimes looked the other way last year might switch gears and go for more timely and consistent enforcement of policies this year.

Of course people can continue to feel they are wrong for taking this stance, or think that enforcement is taking place in too rough a manner.  I'm just putting some context around the changes.

As for whether rules should not be enforced as long as people are ""entirely peaceful,"" on its face that seems like a reasonable stance.  However, I'm pretty sure the Title VI issues suggest that even peaceful actions may constitute a violation.  The threats some lawmakers are making are nothing the University wants to fuck around with.",SayHeyItsAThrowaway,6

Irrelevant. This speech included no death threats, nor was it at anyone‚Äôs resident in the night. It may be all well and good to use police to punish those forms of speech, but this is a separate form of speech. Every major politician receives death threats, that doesn‚Äôt give them a blank check to shut down protest.

> >Annoyance, disruption, taking up space, all of these are part of living everyday life.

The people giving out Qurans or bibles on the Diag are sometimes annoying and they take up some space and impede the flow of traffic. Some preachers on the Diag spew extreme bigotry and wish harm on people, set thing up that interfere with the pathways, and yell. Student groups set up activities on the Diag that disrupt the flow of traffic more significantly all the time. Tahrir protestors allowed people to continue to walk around them.

You‚Äôre annoying and disrupting me by making these comments. Is it significant? Of course not, I could easily ignore them and move on, just like I could if I walked past the protesters. Most or all political speech could be eliminated based on the fact of it being at least a little annoying or disruptive.

>If pro-Israeli protestors significantly blocked the walkways on the diag, I bet the same thing would have happened.

‚ÄúSignificantly‚Äù is a totally arbitrary distinction. Pro-Israel protesters stood on the Diag, made noise, blocked people‚Äôs line of sight.

You as a citizen can reserve the diag and can legally remove uninvited guests from it during the time of reservation. The university had the diag reserved for a university event (Festifall). This means the university's rules apply and all people in the diag have to obey by the university rules during that time. The protestors were blocking the pathways, which is a violation of the rules, which I'm certain will hold up in the courts as it becomes an accessibility and safety issue. The protestors were warned and told they will be arrested for not moving. They didn't comply and were arrested, it got a bit hectic because they resisted their lawful arrest.

All they had to do was go lay in the grass, but they wanted the police confrontation because it brings more attention to them and supports their narrative they are trying to build. The protestors could have actually reserved the diag and did their die-in during their reservation. But they were looking to be as disruptive as possible. So it's nothing to do with their right to speech. You have less free speech in university than in the general public.

No, I don‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs just a fact that most brainwashed Americans DO TEND to fall into one of the two buckets of stupidity because of the influence of media on their brains. It‚Äôs not only a political divide, but a social one, and conservatives DO often complain about people protesting, while liberals DO tend to take up for any social cause they can get their hands on. These are observations. I guessed you were a conservative, but that‚Äôs because everyone‚Äôs political leanings are so predicable you can set a clock to them, that‚Äôs why you assumed I like Genocide Joe and Kamala. That being said, whether you‚Äôre conservative or not, it‚Äôs a typically conservative position to hate protests, and trash-talk protestors, which is crazy coming from the side that claims to look up to the Founding Fathers who threw Tea in the Boston Harbor and went to war against their government. You might be a moderate, but that‚Äôs a particularly conservative position. It‚Äôs the same type of bizarre hypocrisy as when liberals are anti-gun, even though their position is typically that of being PRO-personal freedoms. That comes from legacy media brainwashing.

Ps. If you‚Äôre a liberal, the side who claims to be anti-war, your leaders (the other side‚Äôs leaders too) are the ones who signed this blank check for genocide, so if you have a problem with protestors in your locale, take it up with your genocidal president.",Illustrious-Mix-9810,-1

1238,2024-08-29 20:48:35,0,"There's no way to be certain.

Michigan does permit third party voter registration drives, with no licensing or registration of the people involved. There are some restrictions on how collectors can be compensated, like they can be paid hourly, but not receive commissions based on the number of registrations they obtain. \[[Source](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/-/media/Project/Websites/sos/Resources/Partners-in-Democracy/Elections_VoterRegistrationDriveGuidelines.pdf)\] (Commissions have incentivized people to forge registrations and absentee ballots in states that allow them).

Did the form like the state's [ED-121](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/-/media/Project/Websites/sos/Elections/Election-Forms/Voter-Registration-Form-English.pdf?rev=10b1eafe0fb542c4b352653f5896f43d&hash=2A233AE4D84E018AA0688E0D8801FAD7) registration form?

If so, I think the two most likely adverse consequences (either or both) are:

1. Data will be sold on international market, including to scammers who use peoples' personal information for a variety of crimes, and foreign states who maintain dossiers on Americans, and
2. Your app will be thrown away rather than submitted, as a voter suppression strategy, either selectively (e.g. toss all female and non-binary apps) or across the board for campus registrants.

The voter suppression technique isn't 100% successful, because people can still register to vote on the day of the election, and in the past, polling stations on campus have stayed open past the official close for people already in line, for as long as it takes for those people to register and vote. But it discourages a lot of people who filled out an application ahead of time only to realize they're not registered. A 2022 Daily [article](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/government/midterm-elections-see-long-same-day-registration-lines-on-campus-disappearing-ballots/) on the mid-term election said at campus polling places, some people waited six hours to vote, and polling stations were open past 2am.

1283,2024-08-29 15:22:32,1,"Depends on what you want to take out of the course. If you are taking linear algebra for PhD, it is paramount to take a proof based one since PhD programs want experience with proofs. If you are taking linear algebra to better understand regression models, a proof based one is still important but a more computational one can help in the interim but keep in mind 214 doesn't satisfy stats departments requirements last I checked. Finally, 217 required 215 back when I took it so if you dropped out of 116, you should not attempt 217 (even though you technically do not need much multivariate calculus). If you want to learn the material on a conceptual level with some minor computation, you can always take an online course on it in your free time or watch 3blue1brown's series on it.  

TLDR: Ask yourself why you want to take the course. If it is for PhD, you need 217. If it is for understanding regression/statistical models (not coursework), computational ones like 214 should suffice. If you are taking it for yourself, just do online courses",RunningEncyclopedia,4

You say you are an econ major. What is your motivation for taking the class? If you are doing so for grad school with an expectation of taking higher math, you will certainly need to get Calc II and III credit anyway, and should probably take 217. If you are taking linear algebra just to get a feel for the applications, 214 should be fine and is a considerably easier course.",crwster,2

1298,2024-08-29 14:34:35,0,"With the recent reductions in GSI allocations, a lot of departments are hiring graders in lieu of GSIs as well as supplement them.

You are right that STEM courses at the intro/intermediate level have easier time getting graders, especially undergrads, as they have to follow a strict set of criteria without much leeway and that humanities courses based on writing need a qualified person to make judgement calls on a general rubric. I am not sure if GEO has a stipulation that graders cannot be used for the type of grading you mentioned as that would create a loophole for most humanities courses where grading takes longer due to the essay nature (creates incentive to hire GSI for just discussion section and grader for grading to save money)

I am sure the demotion from GSI position to grader was due to the recent developments (new GEO contract making GSIs more expansive) and if you are masters student it is likely to reduce the number of tuition waivers for the department (otherwise as a PhD student you already do not have to pay tuition). Try your luck but this situation is far too common at the moment...",RunningEncyclopedia,12
1299,2024-08-29 14:34:35,0,"I‚Äôve never heard that graders can‚Äôt do grading that is subjective.  Is that in writing somewhere?

Unless they have a lot of money and couldn‚Äôt find another grader, it seems unlikely that they‚Äôd change it. The tuition waiver part is probably the biggest reason, as the other poster pointed out. Unless things have changed drastically, they don‚Äôt just hand wave the charge away. The  department or the professor have to actually have funds to pay for the tuition. I remember my advisor being very happy when one of us got candidacy because it meant we got way cheaper for him because candidate tuition is way less than normal tuition.

Since you're a baby back Lil B at driving, pull the hand brake up when you need start but don't let go or let the lock out. Ease on the gas and clutch like your starting on flat ground, and when you feel the car start to pull, let the hand brake back down.

If you miss something, even something really small in lecture, ask them ""hey (name), what was that about that"". At the end of class, ""hey (name), it was nice to meet you.

1408,2024-08-29 01:30:05,35,"First of all, change your thinking. Instead of saying ""can't make friends"" say ""haven't been able to make friends yet"". 

Secondly, if you're having trouble staying focused on the conversation it sounds like an issue with anxiety or insecurity. I can't tell you exactly what the issue is but I can tell you that it's very important that you get to the root of this issue if you want to make swift progress. Seeing a psychologist may help. Not saying it's necessary, only that it's so worth it if you can actually begin solving your deep seated issues at an early age rather than allowing them to plague you for most of your adult life.

Third you need to build social skills. You do this through engaging people in conversation repeatedly in different settings. You need to gather a huge database of human interactions and then gradually your brain will start to make connections and come to realizations about what it needs to say in order to keep a conversation going or how to make a joke. If you do this, you will notice gradual improvement over time. 

Lastly, I recommend embracing radical honesty. Do not be afraid to speak the truth and say what you really think. Of course you need to use discretion and there are times when you probably shouldn't do this, but in general the more honest you are, the more your interactions will feel real and authentic and people will also respect you more. Of course, some people won't like you and they will be angry that you don't conform to societal norms but also more people will love you and this is a better alternative than having everyone think you're just ok. Your words will also have more power when you speak the truth and you will experience more personal growth and open up more.",Better-Lack8117,21

If you liked linear algebra, take 420 (though this will probably be a bit hard) or 312/412 for some abstract algebra. If you want a great all around class that (IMHO) should be a mandatory part of the math minor anyway, take 451 (or, the easier version in 351).

 For pre-med you have to maximize your GPA above all else (my friend that did BME + Pre-Med struggled so much getting into T-25 med programs due to having a above average engineering GPA but a below average GPA compared to Pre-Meds with cupcake majors) so struggling with intensive Spanish that is 8-10 credits might not be the best idea if yo are not a language person",RunningEncyclopedia,1

They expanded their stores and opened more stores.  So they did not have a lot of $ on hand in 2019/2020.

COVID hit and their sales plummeted.  They bought $6,000,000 in merch going into fall 2020 thinking students would be back.

Took out high interest loans to pay vendors.

NIL came about and MDen decided to jump into it in 2021 but that cost $ reducing their profits.

COVID messed with supply lines which made it harder for MDen to get the inventory they wanted.  They bought millions in inventory that came later than expected, after the F22 football season.  So sales were lower.  MDen wasn‚Äôt able to pay all their vendors and lawsuits came out.

1615,2024-08-28 02:24:26,132,"Some potential reasons:

1) During the 2021-22 years they paid suppliers to manufacture championship game tshirts just in case but they had to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù (send to poor country, there is probably a Falcons SB jersey from 28-3 somewhere) them as we didn‚Äôt make it

2) They over-produced during the 2021-23 stretch and had to mark a lot of the stuff down. When all my undergrad friends graduated in 2022 they spent a fortune on playoff apperal but I got them for $5-15 after a year or two

3) The largest debt holder is UofM (licensing) 

4) Unprofitable satellite stores with back rent (minor debt holder)

5) The apperal is too expensive when relevant (right before/after big games) and sell cheaper after loosing relevancy. This can be considered a type of price discrimination (charge more to people that can afford $30/tshirt and later $/15-10-5 for Tshirt). The strategy worked at UofM with students but didn‚Äôt with satelite stores away from UofM hence #4

1784,2024-08-27 23:13:02,202,"Apologies for the lengthy blurb, but I've been annoyed by the amount of people in my generation who can vote but don't, and so here we are.

The issue is that we live in a two-party system and that, realistically, one of Trump or Harris will be the next president. Trump does seem to be more blindly pro-Israel than Harris - but, even if you do genuinely believe they are both equal on the issue, I find it likely that, if you're pro-Palestine, you're also in support of other issues (such as abortion rights, and/or LGBTQIA+ rights, and/or freedom of speech and/or religion) that you're more likely to vote for Harris than Trump on. It also sounds like you voted in the Democratic primary, so I'm guessing you tend to vote more Democratic than Republican. If I'm right about any of this, meaning that you probably would have voted for Harris if not for her Israel-Palestine stance (which you think Trump is equally bad for), voting for nobody is essentially taking away a vote from Harris. It's not like neither of them will win as a result of your voting uncommitted - it's that Trump is ever so slightly more likely to win. And if you genuinely have no preference between the two of them, well, I disagree with you, but you'll at least be voting your conscience. But, if that's not the case, and you do have some slight preference for one candidate over the other, then your not voting is really just taking away a vote for the candidate that you'd like to win. Even if they do notice that a lot of people have voted uncommitted over Palestine, what then? Either Harris wins, in which case, if you're right that all she cares about is the votes, it doesn't matter whether or not you voted uncommitted - or, Trump wins, in which case Trump is president and also Harris has less direct power to take action over that issue, especially after January. Maybe, in four years, if she or someone else runs again, and if they're convinced by this election, and if the situation persists, they could take action on it then - but wouldn't things be even more irrevocable at that point?

For the record, I say this as someone who also voted uncommitted in the primary, precisely because I do not approve of how this administration has handled this. I voted uncommitted there because I wanted to make it clear that this was an issue, both morally and because it could pose a real risk for them in the general election because of people that would not vote. I also voted uncommitted because there was no candidate who stood a chance of winning that primary that I would be substantially more unhappy with than any other candidate. I will not vote uncommitted in the general election (which I also believe was the larger uncommitted voter movement's official stance at the time - I seem to remember them encouraging people to vote for Biden in the general election still over Trump, though I could well be misremembering). I will not vote uncommitted because I have the power to make it ever so slightly more likely that Harris becomes president instead of Trump, and I really, *really* do not want Trump to be president.

 I am not saying that protest is wrong, or that I think that the way the Biden-Harris administration has handled everything is right; I am saying that, by the way the system works, one of Biden and Harris is almost certainly going to be president, and not voting for one of them is simply making it more likely that whoever you would have voted for will lose. I fully get the sentiment that politicians should be the ones who have to win over our votes, because that definitely *should* be the case. However, the fact is that my vote still holds some small amount of power; and, even if I wish Harris would have to work harder to earn my vote, the fact that she currently doesn't doesn't absolve me of any responsibility from how I'm voting, and whatever (admittedly small) amount of impact it can and will have. The flawed nature of a system does not negate its present existence.

  
If what you were saying was that you had voted uncommitted in the primary, but were planning on voting for somebody in the election, I'm sorry for misunderstanding you.",befuddled_cat,7

Blaming the victims of a genocide on the votes of a small minority of the country in total, especially considering that over half the population and those being killed are literal children, is actually morally disgusting.

I told my section this at the time: ‚ÄúWith active approach you put in consistent effort to reduce the variance of your grade. It incentivizes you to attend lecture and slightly protects you against having a bad day in an exam (ex: you were sick during the exam, happend to me as a freshman)‚Äù.

In my personal opinion: traditional approach can work for students who are able to cram before an exam, do well but active approach is better as it reduces exam weight (at expense of minor assignments each lecture) while incentiving you to attend lectures and learn daily.

RC language courses are notorious for being time-sinks. They are intensive courses so think them as taking two courses together so doing badly on an exam/quiz/assignment will for sure tank your GPA for a considerable while. As such you need to dedicate a lot of time to the course to do well as it is half your GPA that semester and furthermore, they meet near daily and as such will require you to put in time every day.

I recall Calc I as 115 so correct me if I am wrong but Calc I/II sequence in UofM are also notorious for being super time intensive so having all day lecture from 9-2 with a 90 minute lunch break 3 days a week will not help

Overall, I'd say you will be spending nearly all day after your classes end M/T/Th doing assignments and you should make sure you are disciplined to dedicate Wednesday's to study. When I had a free day in undergrad, I usually did not get much done that day and usually slept in until noon.

I was a member of the Michigan Student Assembly.  This will date me but divestment was being pushed even in 2005.  We had a huge vote on it and our MSA meeting was moved to the Union in order to allow for all of the people who chose to attend.  It was a symbolic proposal at the time, because MSA did not have authority to direct the investments of Michigan's endowment.

At the time I empathized with Israeli's and Palestinians who both felt wronged by others in a long conflict.  I was grateful to be American and largely free from wars and violence.  I also felt like this was an issue that was supposed to be debated in other venues, not MSA, and that MSA shouldn't be trying to dictate investment strategy to the endowment.  The endowment's goal is to provide support for the maintenance and growth of the university in perpetuity and should not take on goals beyond that.

Anyway, I voted no on divestment and it's interesting to see the issue only grew over time to the point where normal campus life is being harmed by it.

I have argued with them about how they should try to win at the ballot box instead of just LARPing in camps on the Diag. They all laughed at me and explained voting does nothing (one guy alluded that violent revolution was the only way forward at UMich). The real power is with the regents, yet TAHRIR and the like are targeting the student population more effectively.

As we saw with Regent candidate Huwaida Arraf, she got extremely close to being the Democrat Regent candidate (an almost guarantee to get elected). All TAHRIR had to do was run another candidate and just canvas in a few more districts, they would easily get 2 new Regents who supported Divestment elected. The problem is that TAHRIR thought camping on the diag was more important than driving to other districts in the state and knocking on doors. With how little Huwaida Arraf did and how she relied too much on 1 district, this honestly would have been a cakewalk.

I have no problem with differing political views, but if your means to achieve them are to make everyone miserable, you better at least be effective.

All of CSG's money comes directly from students and not any investment of the university (which many believe is profiting off Gaza).

A decent number of GEO members were annoyed by GEO using its time and resources for political activism as opposed to looking after its members (especially considering the blindside hit that was the GSI  cuts). I recall a lot of people quit after GEO's public stance towards Israel-Palestine conflict that did not benefit the union uniformly with regards to its public goodwill with students. GEO already had a bad rep with certain subset of students due to the strike (moderate and conservative leaning students) and instead of  gaining a weak but broad support from the students in relation to its future contract negotiations (ex: explaining grad student salaries, how PhD programs work, work conditions etc. to make a more students sympathetic to the cause), it chose to get unwavering support from a vocal minority (YDSA and allies) while totally alienating themselves from others.

2059,2024-08-27 01:44:45,3,"Copying this from the last time this was asked!

Hi, I tutor Orgo and specialize at working with UMich and Berkeley students.

In gen-chem, problem solving is mostly isolated, that is, save for a few things like stoichiometry and concentrations, the skills required to solve an electrochemistry problem are completely orthogonal from those needed to solve a buffer problem for instance. This is not the case for Chem 210.

The main reason why I get struggling students after exam 2 or 3 desperately needing help is because they didn't understand that everything builds from the very beginning, in particular, the understanding of lewis structures, electron flow (resonance/curved arrows) and the way in which these explain how charge distribution can change within a molecule or during a reaction mechanism. This is the language of organic chemistry and therefore if you just skated by without getting it, you can be all the way in exam 3 giving answers that are completely nonsensical because you don't understand what is really going on and are just copying from a template.

In order to fix this, what I do with any new student, regardless of where they are in the course, is go over lewis structures, formal charges, hybridization, resonance, and reaction mechanisms, and only then can we get into whatever they want to know.

You will be completely fine, but your life is going to be so much easier if you just focus a lot on that sort of introductory part of the course and don't let go of it as new topics are introduced. You should be able to explain concepts like basicity, acidity, nucleophilicity and electrophilicity with appropriate lewis/resonance structures and know the why. (i.e Base X is weaker as there's electron delocalization to the more electronegative oxygen, which is not the case for Base Y).

One final thing is that a lot of students ""study to the test"" and get upset or dissapointed when the exams introduce an unfamiliar bit of chemistry that wasn't covered in lecture or whatever. That will always happen and therefore you need to have that solid foundational logic and make analogies to the reactions and mechanisms you do know. I'm rooting for you!",juleslovesprog,1

2187,2024-08-26 21:42:03,417,"Here are a few numbers pulled off of the Registrar's website.  Last Fall, UM-AA enrolled 3,849 new freshmen who were residents and 3,617 new freshmen who were nonresidents.

Looking at total undergrads that fall  (not just new incoming freshmen) U-M enrolled 17,547 residents and 16,183 nonresidents.   Furthermore, that 17,547 is the highest number of residents that have been enrolled in 7 years (maybe longer, the Registrar's report just goes back to 2016).

This is Fall 23 data because it'll be a few weeks before Fall 2024 enrollment is official, but the pattern and the trend will surely be the same.  **U-M enrolls more resident undergrads than it does nonresident undergrads**.  It enrolls more nonresidents than it used to, and the proportion is closer to 50-50% than it used to be, but residents still outnumber their out of state classmates.

What about how many students get \*accepted\* to the University?  That's a different story.  The University admits many more nonresidents than residents,  Why?  Because on average far fewer of them will accept the offer and enroll as students.  U-M is a much more expensive institution to attend if you don't live in Michigan, so it's not going to stack up as well against students' other college options (some of which may be way cheaper if they are in the student's home state).  Whereas if you live in Michigan and get admitted, suddenly you have a choice that is highly regarded AND is reasonable (even affordable if you get aid).  Knowing more residents will say yes after being admitted, the University sends out fewer acceptance letters to Michiganders.  So to be clear: more nonresidents may get the acceptance letter, but that doesn't mean that UM is, in the end, going to enroll more nonresidents.

You can focus in on various aspects of this and bend the story around, but MLive is making claims that it cannot back up with actual data.  It is probably because the reporter/editors are less familiar with higher education data and terminology and don't know how to interpret reports, and they got so excited about this hot story they didn't do enough checking of their data.

""Built"" as in the buildings? Utterly shallow perspective, considering the immense variety and amounts of labours that went into ""building"" the school including financial, logistical, and, above all, intellectual ones - all of which people from all over the world have had a hand in. For instance, the university gained its academic prestige from being among the very first modern research universities in America, under the German model - the effort of James Burill Angell, who was from Rhode Island.  
Intellectually, America itself was a rather backwater nation until they snatched the German scientists after WW2, UM being among the recipients of that legacy. UM also became a Jewish haven after the Ivy League Jewish quota was discreetly set in place and has benefited immensely as a result. The vast majority of the faculty is not even from Michigan, with probably half coming from overseas even, and they never have been. Our physics department owes much of its early success to George Uhlenbeck, who was Dutch.

2264,2024-08-26 21:42:03,417,"In this case, it's not education as a whole that is being gatekept, it is education at the University of Michigan. That's an important distinction. Gatekeeping is not inherently an evil thing either - some decisions need to be made given that the university is a finite space with finite resources. I'm outlining some of the options to navigate that space below, curious what your solution is:

1. UofM can accept every Michigander applicant, no questions asked, and only start applying ""standards"" to out-of-state applicants once they have accepted every native one. This removes all barriers to in-state applicants and lets it serve its residents.
2. UofM can invest more of its resources into enabling greater attendance. This can be general, e.g. building more housing, or specific to in-state students, e.g. making it financially more plausible.
3. UofM can adopt lower benchmarks for in-state eligibility (e.g. lower ACT/SAT scores, lower GPAs, worse essays, etc.).
4. UofM can adopt a quota where X percent of the incoming class must be Michigander.
5. UofM maintains the status quo.

The issue with 1 and 3 is that it ultimately defeats the purpose of the world-class education that the university can offer, because even of those it admits with its high standards, not everyone can handle the workload. If you open the floodgates to less qualified students, you either have to accept that there will be a lot of failing students or that the courses will need to be made less demanding. The former is terrible from the perspective of enabling your students to succeed, the latter is terrible because you now have less rigor and depth.

The issue with 2 is that, well, the university is already doing it. The Go Blue guarantee, in-state scholarships, construction on new dorms... you can say that they should do it faster/better, but they are trying.

5 has worked so far. You can say that the purpose of a state university is to serve its state, but it is already doing so disproportionately - the state of Michigan comprises only 3% of the population of the country, but 40+% of the students are from the state, despite only 13% of its funding coming from the state. It also provides cheaper tuition and scholarships to in-state students.

I think that 4 is the most realistic option if change is desired, but I don't think that 4 is related to lowering standards. It is no secret that tons of applicants are qualified to attend this university, and numbers suggest that even a great applicant might be passed over. If you have a quota system, then more qualified Michigander applicants can get in. Note that this does not diminish the quality of the education that is offered because they belong there and earned it.",Swagicus,5

2346,2024-08-26 14:45:15,85,"I wanted to add some information that wasn‚Äôt included in this article.

The turn out for Huwaida was very large on Saturday. I would say that probably 1/4-1/3 of people in the convention center were wearing ‚ÄúHuwaida for Regent‚Äù t-shirts. A large portion of these supporters were young students/alumni/community members.

Though very outspokenly pro-Palestinian, Huwaida ran on multiple other platforms, one of which included expanding the Go Blue Guarantee to ensure more families can afford tuition. Aside from this, she offered a voice to a considerable portion of the student body that, whether you like it or not, has been largely sidelined by the current administration.

As for the voting process, the Regent nominees were the only ticket that was voted on at the convention (all other candidates were immediately elected and referendums were deferred to be voted on at a later date). The convention required delegates to use the mobile app Voatz (which has [security concerns](https://news.mit.edu/2020/voting-voatz-app-hack-issues-0213) levied against it by researchers at MIT, some of which are still to be addressed). Polling opened for the regents at approximately 3:40pm on Saturday, and was open for around an hour. After polls closed, no update was given on the process until around 5:20, when it was announced that votes were still being counted. The next update was at around 5:50, ten minutes before the convention was scheduled to end, where an announcer said that the votes had been counted, and now the calculations had begun (votes are weighted by county in a process that was not and has not been completely disclosed to the public). Around this time, there were reports of several cop cars around the convention center, and multiple cops came inside to ‚Äúmake sure delegates left peacefully after the results were announced‚Äù. Finally, the announcer came back out on stage over an hour later (and an hour after the convention had ended) and announced the final tallies for each candidate, said that Illitch and Diggs won, then hurried off backstage. There were indeed boos and chants after the results, however I left soon after the announcement, so I can‚Äôt personally speak to the nature of how the group left the center.

Throughout this voting process, no members of Huwaida‚Äôs team or staff were allowed backstage to view the process. I‚Äôm not sure if the same can be said for Illitch and Diggs‚Äô team and staff, however I do know that one of the current Regents was allowed backstage during the counting and calculations.

All this is to say that Huwaida was a candidate popular amongst several groups of students and community members, and platformed on giving a voice to those groups during a time in which they have felt ignored. She had a large crowd of supporters at the convention, and appeared to have a really good shot at securing one of the two seats. I‚Äôll be honest and say that I don‚Äôt have much experience with these kind of conventions and I don‚Äôt really know much about how the voting process normally goes, but there are multiple points here that I think warrant some kind of audit to ensure the election‚Äôs integrity.",Due-Potato2618,16
2347,2024-08-26 14:45:15,85,">Huwaida Arraf‚Ä¶ fell a little more than 100 votes behind Ilitch and about 500 votes behind Diggs

Not accurate, Arraf won more votes but was behind on points, because of the weighted voting system used at the convention.

Additionally, Arraf‚Äôs campaign did not have observers/auditors to oversee the counting process, which involved large amounts of math done by hand. The demand for more transparency on the math is totally reasonable, and would be the standard in any free and fair election.",IsThisReallyNate,4

We are talking about supporters of the war, so your point about the protests is useless. Most supporters of the war were due to the belief that Saddam (a ruthless dictator) was amassing weapons of mass destruction. The protestors were mostly against the war because it was preemptive. The clarity of intel was shaky. Saddam did have chemical weapons but were mostly very old munitions and not a serious threat, but that wasn't understood until a while after the war took place. So not only did you make a useless point when we were talking about the regret of the supporters, but likely because you were very young during this, you really don't have a grasp on the context.

> ok, cool, then divestment from Israeli investments should be as easy as divestment from Russian investments 

Why do I have to dispel this dumb point over and over on here? The University only divested from Russia due to federal sanctions. It was the same situation with divesting from South Africa. The university only divested due to the State law requiring it (the University also challenged that law to the state Supreme Court). Almost entirely throughout the history of the University's endowment, the Regents have held the position to not make politically based investments but to only invest in ways that secure the best financial future for the University. 

As a matter of principle to not further risk the financial security of the university, the Regents should never give in to politically motivated divestment movements. Due to there being so many conflicts in the world, how incredibly financially tied together everything is, and how it seems that no degree of separation appeases many of the protest movements, truly divesting from every perceived conflict of the world would essentially destroy the endowment.",_iQlusion,7

Most private equity are not all eggs in one basket (way too much risk), they are distributed across multiple private ownership (aka private shares). You are mistaken in thinking all indexes have massive amounts of holdings like the S&P 500 and the Dow. There are plenty of indexes that have a small variety of holdings because those indexes are typical indexes on niche markets. Indexes just have to have a distributed representation of a target market.

Venture capital is just private ownership during the startup phase and due to how often startups fail, most venture capital funds are distributed across a lot of startups. So effectively holding money in an index fund vs private equity/VC is no different.

2521,2024-08-25 21:42:21,1,"EECS 215 is relatively chill and easy for the first third but the difficultly ramps up after midterm 1. The good thing is that there is a lot of support available which is not as available in more upper level EE classes so take advantage of that to build a solid foundation for the concepts since 215 is the foundation class for anything in EE(along with 216). I would also suggest learning some basics of diff eq, mainly solving first and second order equations, and Laplace transforms. Additionally get quite comfy with complex numbers. While a review and the very basics are provided in the class, if you are already familiar with them then your life will be significantly easier

EECS 200 is quite chill and you get an intro to a lot of EE sub fields and are able to apply them. Helps you in exploring and choosing future elective courses. The workload isn‚Äôt too high either.",Tiny-Mongoose3824,1

This small group of students decided they should make life for everyone on campus more miserable by not funding things like student organizations and the food pantry for people in need. If you are a student group trying to raise funds let's say stop the possible genocide that is happening in Sudan, you are shit out of luck because the students who got elected to CSG decided their causes and political ideology are more important than yours. So instead of supporting student organizations mostly equally, these radicals that got elected decided your family getting murdered in Sudan isn't a cause worth supporting over theirs.

Now fortunately for us, these radicals that got elected are mostly larpers, who can barely show up for their classes and spend more time virtue signalling on Instagram and Twitter than doing actual productive work to support their cause. Thus so many of the radicals on CSG got procedurally replaced because they didn't show up enough to the CSG meetings. All they had to do was show up to these meetings and do nothing but really just sit there. But that was too much actual work for them because CSG has fixed meetings and these radicals have problems with time management. So enough of the radicals got replaced on CSG, so funding for student organizations is expected to start again soon.

To summarize, the radicals (many who are self-admitted supporters of a terrorist organization) only managed to just disrupt the summer semester because they were too lazy to show up to meetings and do nothing. Funding should be resuming this semester.",_iQlusion,121

They should explain both methods to you in detail on the first day of class, and you have a week to decide! You also have the opportunity to change your grading style after the midterm.

Another factor that influenced my decision was that I'm very introverted, and mandatory group work in each lecture sounded like hell imo. If you choose the inactive ver, you can still ACCESS the group work (as long as you open the file before they close it off at the end of lecture) and complete it, but it doesn't really count for anything except extra practice.

Remember that med schools require certain prerequisites. Some of those aren‚Äôt included in engineering curriculum, therefore you will have to go above and beyond the hard engineering classes. 

My advice would be to do something that sets you apart from every other pre med student. An engineering degree will definitely set you on that path, but it wont be easy. Especially if you‚Äôre looking at EE. I‚Äôd suggest you take it a semester at a time and really think about whether you want to spend 4 years in undergrad, 4 years in med school, and 4+ years in residency to become a doctor.

2872,2024-08-24 00:36:40,2,"Would recommend against majoring in engineering just as a path to medical school. As someone said above, engineering classes are challenging, but the GPAs of engineering students tend to be far lower than those of other majors. In the engineering world, this is not a problem because everyone knows that and the standards are different. Applying to medical school with a relatively lower gpa, even though it‚Äôs a more difficult major, is going to give you an unnecessarily difficult battle during the application process.

If you‚Äôre passionate about engineering then go for it. But don‚Äôt major in it just because you want to do premed. The truth is you can major in anything you want as long as you take the core science classes at some point and get your volunteer/shadowing/clinical/research hours. These days, you would definitely have a better chance majoring in something you‚Äôre passionate about and enjoy, doing well in that, and then applying to med school with a more unique background rather than just bio or chem. Choosing a sensible major that you can get a decent job in as a backup is fine but don‚Äôt pick something you hate. When people ask about it, they‚Äôll be able to tell you hate it and that‚Äôs not a good look. It‚Äôll give you a better chance to major in something that, when people ask you in interviews, you‚Äôll light up and energetic and excited to talk about it. 

I‚Äôd also recommend doing a gap year or two after you graduate to get some work experience (usually in research or some type of clinical work) just for the personal growth and experience instead of going straight through to medical school. There‚Äôs no rush!",DoctorTurtleDuck,1

Under technical skills you don't list your proficiency. My assumption for new grads that list a bunch of languages and tools on their resume but do not list what proficiency, is you barely know how to use any of them and just put many things on your resume to seem impressive. Especially since you put things like Ubuntu, do you really know any software and/or tooling specific to Ubuntu and not other Linux distros? I bet not, so putting Ubuntu instead of Linux, paints the picture that you really aren't that familiar with Linux. Pretty much the same sentiment that you list with VS Code and Visual Studio. Most jobs really don't care what IDE or text editor you use unless they have a ton of specific scripting for those. Which I am assuming you really don't have an advance usage of those tools. Its also odd you list GCC on a different section than CMake, they should be grouped together. CMake is a build system, so I am not sure why it would not be in developer tools or why GCC. Are you really an advance user of GCC? If I had to guess you probably aren't familiar with the many different GCC extensions add versus what is ANSI C or ISO C++. 

So basically there are a bunch of obvious things that stick out at the top of your resume that paint you as someone who doesn't understand those languages, tools, etc. Often companies have engineers like myself screen resumes once before calling in for an interview. So right off the bat there's a bunch stuff that would dissuade me from reading further on your resume.

Without spending a bunch of time on your resume bullet points for experience (quick glance they look average but missing their impact), the overall sense I get is you are really interested in game development. Which is very hard industry to get into without a portfolio of stuff you made.  

Also your internship was 2 years ago, what happened the last two summers? That immediately sticks out as a potential red flag. FYI doing research or jobs on campus always comes across as you either failed to get a job in industry and it was a last resort, or you are looking to work in academia. 

You resume also looks like you really don't have a personality as it there isn't anything but game development on it. I always tell young engineers if they have an interesting hobby to put it on their resume, because it typically catches peoples eye and they will dig a bit deeper on your resume.

Overall its not the best resume and if you sent this resume to non-gaming companies I would see why they would pass up on you. I don't know about the gaming industry that much, so I won't speak about how the resume will do with those types of jobs. 

Honestly, it looks like the people who reviewed your resume did you dirty and gave you bad advice.",_iQlusion,2

2905,2024-08-24 00:02:01,61,Clubs are generally separated from internships. Looks fine.  Read Gayle McDowell(I think that‚Äôs her last name) on how to write good bullet points. Remove the words qa engineer from your resume.,Critical_Farmer_361,1
2906,2024-08-24 00:02:01,61,"Okay, this is better, but here are the major issues you have.

1. This resume kind of screams master of game dev. Assuming you're not applying for game dev roles (and considering you've sent 700+ apps I assume not), this resume is still way too focused on game dev. It's unclear what roles you're targeting (backend/frontend/fullstack/ml/etc.) You don't have to have a speciality or anything, but a kind of broad direction is good. Fullstack + ML? Frontend? etc. This again is indicated by the projects you choose to display & the bullets you use to highlight exp. You have 2 game dev projects + bullets that kind of seem, all over the place? You have 1 frontend exp + 2 game dev + 1 AR + 2 game dev projects. I'm not really sure what to get from this. If you're not targeting game dev roles I would replace your projects and select your bullets for those exps better. For example, pioneered an accessible, flexible, game engine"" is a good first bullet because it's broad enough, but the rest are useless. ""Developed 2d+ shaders"", ""Implemented A\* pathfinding"", ""Engineered a scalable, modular enemy wave system"", ""Created RPG, RTS, and Tower Defense templates"" are frankly not good bullet points if you're not game dev. If a role is hiring for Backend SWE I don't care about any of the above. You're highlighting the wrong parts of your experience. Did you work in a team? Use cloud services? Highlight other parts of what you did. Same goes with bunch of bullets under other exp.
2. The other glaring issue is that your bullet points don't follow STAR. Firstly, I don't see a single metric/result/statistic anywhere in your resume which is definitely not helping you pass screens. Secondly, I don't see the point in some of your bullets. For example, ""Streamlined source control via Bitbucket while engaging in global communication and collaboration"" is a really weak bullet among several. Another example is, ""Created responsive particle systems for an immersive experience, consistently testing to ensure functionality"". This barely tells me anything, and ""consistently testing to ensure functionality"" is not really something to be highlighting in your resume either. I would suggest cutting this and replacing it with something else altogether, or even a stronger rephrasing might be something like ""Integrated responsive particle systems using React, Node.js, [Socket.io](http://Socket.io) to enhance user experience, resulting in 50% increase in interaction rates"" or something. You want all your bullets to follow the format of ""Developed \[xyz\] to accomplish \[xyz\] using \[x, y, z\], resulting in \[xyz\]"".
3. Smaller nit, but the formatting of your technical skills is kind of janky. You should stick to 3 lines, and there's no need for Advanced/Beginner. I saw someone else tell you to list proficiency. This is just bad advice. Look at how Jake's resume does it for example, this is industry standard.

To be blunt, if people are telling you this resume looks good for general SWE apps you need to get it reviewed by better people",tovarischstalin,2
2907,2024-08-24 00:02:01,61,"Disagree with not including interests, hobbies, etc. Ultimately, you will work with and for humans. Show that you are more than a coder, programmer, robot, etc.. Nothing like being an interviewer reading a resume of someone who is a manga fan, in training to pilot an airplane, has visited 5 of 7 continents, etc. Fun facts are the way to go. What makes you special from the 100s of other CS grads? Consider emphasizing your MDE project, too.",Chubbins_23,1
2908,2024-08-24 00:02:01,61,"Thanks, this is really helpful. Honestly, I‚Äôm interested in game dev, of course, but am open, and probably have to, apply for other roles as well. I think I‚Äôm gonna make two resumes, one for game dev, and one for web dev. The experiences will be the same, but I‚Äôll focus on more relevant stuff in the bullet points. I‚Äôll post both once I do.

Not as big of a deal, but do you think it‚Äôs better to use the default font in Jake‚Äôs Resume, or roboto, like I just used in my last resume. I think roboto is more readable, but also a lot bigger, so I can‚Äôt fit as much stuff. It‚Äôs probably not a huge deal, but was just wondering.

2916,2024-08-23 21:20:28,7,"**Research**

If you are a senior, the honors track (doing research with faculty guidance) is out of the question. You can still apply for the Research Seminar courses (ECON 495 last I recall) and do a semester long research project if you choose so.

TLDR: ECON 495 Research Seminar for semester long research

**Clubs**

When I was finishing undergraduate, Michigan Journal of Economics (MJE) and M-etrics (Econometrics club) were started by the same group. During my time MJE was more writing focused with a research group publishing short (short compared to economics research in academia) term research projects (semester to year long as well as course projects) and M-etrics was focused on teaching Python and regression (introductory skills for econometrics as opposed to discussing advanced literature). You can still join the clubs and get some quantitative exposure. I am not sure how they have changed since my time but they do take seniors

TLDR: M-Etrics and MJE

**Self Research/Reading**

Reading books by economists directed at general audiences can be helpful too! These books do not delve into the nitty gritty methodology but summarize a lot of key findings and help you get a broader exposure. If you have the fundamentals from an econ major you can even think back to the the actual models.

Statistics-wise, you can probably learned basic regression skills through 251 or 452 sequence. You can expand on your skills via taking Introduction to Statistical Learnings free online course (undergrad version of a widely used machine learning book).

TLDR: Just do it on your own

**Online Courses**

Michigan students have access to Michigan's Coursera courses. You can learn Python and some basic data science through it.

They told me as soon as someone moved in, I didn't have to pay rent anymore. I went to drop off a rent check and as I was leaving I saw a cat in my old apartment so I had to call and ask for my check back.

3023,2024-08-22 18:47:51,8,"Panera Coffee subscription pays for itself if you use it daily or more than once a day. During my master's I was using Panera Coffee at least 3-4 times a day (every 2 hours almost) 4-5 days a week (whenever I was on campus) so it was approaching making the coffee at home costwise. The coffee is not good but free coffee is better than no coffee. Furthermore, sip club perks can save money on food too since a Panera Value Duet, plus free coffee plus 2 dollar pastry is a $8-9 lunch/dinner of at least 1000 calories ($7 without pastry). You also get other rewards but Value Duets are by far the best deal possible. I think I had the BBQ Chicken Value duet for an entire semester straight after my noon classes like clockwork.

Realistic alternatives depend on your situation. Some departments have free coffee in their department kitchens (sometimes with milk/creamer) for staff+grad students; however, if you are not part of the department or a sister department (sharing a building and/or frequent cross department collaborations), just taking that coffee would be frowned upon. I think the Physics Student Lounge on 3rd floor has such coffee for students but I am unsure about the rules around its usage. Please do not spoil departmental privileges for numerous graduate students by abusing it (Panera experienced this with cups for a while where you had to literally ask for a cup even with the membership)

\[Please correct this if it is outdated:\] Before COVID campus coffee shops like Burts used to do $1 refill for your own cup so if it still exists it is also a plausible alternative but would be more expensive than Panera after 12-15 refills a month.

Finally, depending on how much coffee you drink, investing in a good insulated mug might be worth it. If you just drink 1/2 cups a day, having a cup before you leave home and one in a well insulated mug might be the cheapest option. Despite the hate, Yeti and Stanley cups keep your drinks warm/cold for an extended period of time but classic Contigo style thermoses are safer (less risk of leakage) and are significantly cheaper (A $10 Contigo lasted me 1/2 years in undergrad)",RunningEncyclopedia,11

I'm not aware of any clubs or project teams for chip design, which is sad. Somebody should start one.¬†

It is definitely possible to do research without 470 (I did), but I'm not sure which professors currently have any openings, its kinda just RNG AFAIK. The PURE ECE program thing seems like a good opportunity, but the app dealine is passed and i didnt check if any profs are offering research in RTL. I would email lots of professors in the ECE department with your resume and transcript, and ask if they have any projects you can work on. I would ask your course professors (i.e. 470) for advice in office hours and also set up an advising appointment.

Personally, I believe post-grad is necessary for a good salary. Go ahead and look at chip company career pages and see their application requirements. SUGS or another masters is probably your best option.

Your best bet for career-wise is to pick an idea to target and implement, and prototype the logic and peripherals on an FPGA (buy one for yourself) with built-in cpu logic.

The upcoming fall semester is also my 5th year (9th semester) at UMich. I am an international student who first came to UMich back in fall 2018. Up until first semester of sophomore year, I was maintaining 3.5 gpa, but during the winter 2020 semester when COVID happened, I was not able to focus on classes because of remote learning and ended up with multiple C's which were all luckily masked with P's, so no damage was done to my cgpa. Then I took 2 years of gap year to go back to my country for mandatory military service. I came back fall 2022 semester, but I was seriously burned out from serving and also getting back to an academic setting was very difficult transition for me. Although I was barely able to get above 3.00 gpa that semester, subsequent semesters I got below 3.00 gpa, and, ultimately, I got below 2.00 gpa the past winter semester, resulting in me being placed in academic probation. Back then, I would be upset with getting B's but now I don't really care even when I get C's and D's. I would also feel really anxious back then when I missed quizzes that didn't count towards final grades, but now I dont really give a shit about missing exams and quizzes (in fact I skipped all exams for one particular class and ended up with an E). I feel extremely devastated, and I have occasional lingering suicidal thoughts because of how much I screwed up college. I had nearly no friends throughout college and was never, ever socially active. I feel like crap when students around me are seemingly doing well academically and being active socially/making great college memories while I am stuck in my room most of the times not being able to focus on studying, wasting time on the internet, etc. My parents never know how much I am struggling in college, and I feel extemely guilty because they spent around $300k to send me here to study.

3065,2024-08-22 05:11:10,64,"Hey, it‚Äôs going to be okay! I graduated from UM in 2021 with a BS in Neuroscience. In high school, I had a 3.9 GPA. School and APs were always easy for me, so when I got to Michigan, I expected the same. 

In college, I struggled. Hard. No matter what I did, I couldn‚Äôt get better than C‚Äôs in my STEM classes, and I had 2 W's. I also had to deal with anxiety and bad depression (with the help of therapy). 

My advice is: do your best and know that doesn‚Äôt have to mean getting A‚Äôs or B's. Your best effort will look different every day. Cross the finish line, and don‚Äôt give up. If you have space for a fun class or something you're interested in, it can make a big difference mentally. If not a class, be intentional about a new or existing hobby‚Äîsomething that can give your brain a break and remind you there's more to life than this moment. 

Your friends, s/o, and parents aren't wrong because you are doing something that is *really fucking hard to do*. No matter where you finish, a Bachelor's degree is no small feat.

I graduated with a 3.0 GPA, which would have been my worst nightmare freshman year. But when I got my degree, I was elated. After grad I took
a gap year and a half to regroup. I was anxious when applying for MPH schools because my GPA was so low, but I got into 3 of the best public health schools, including Michigan. I‚Äôm about to start the last year of my MPH at one of the best schools in the country, and I love what I‚Äôm doing now.

I promise it will get better :)",agentcfox,5
3066,2024-08-22 05:11:10,64,"I‚Äôm also in my 5th year at UMich and have been struggling a bit the past years. I used to be the biggest go-getter and like you, started off really strong my first two years. Then I had a really toxic relationship and friend situation that I, thankfully, left but left me starting junior year friendless basically. And I was at the time studying stuff I HATED. I was told to study something because I was good at it and I always grew up following direction so.. I went with it. These factors plus a few other things really took a toll and I found myself slipping. 

I switched my senior year to what I wanted and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here another year‚Äî I desperately want to study medicine. Problem is, I‚Äôm really bad at science which are the classes that matter the most. I‚Äôve had multiple Ws and Ps and am wayyyy behind in things like ECs and shadowing etc etc, all while so many friends are graduated/graduating and doing great. Feels like I‚Äôm left behind. I used to be the ace student and now it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in last place (at least it feels that way). It‚Äôs hard, so I get where you‚Äôre coming from. 

College is a lot of pressure for everything‚Äî growing up, classes, social groups, securing jobs, getting into grad school, you name it. And it‚Äôs different for everyone. I have friends here with 3.9-4.0 gpas. I have friends who have a million clubs and activities and are living college like it‚Äôs the greatest ever. And I have friends who have been miserable at college, even one who took classes each summer so they could get the heck outta here. What I‚Äôm trying to get at is it‚Äôs okay to struggle and feel like you‚Äôre failing. It‚Äôs okay for undergrad to not be perfect. At the end of the day you will get your degree, and eventually in the future you will get into your career as long as you keep trying‚Äî and it seems you‚Äôre doing just that. 

There is no right way, there is no timeline. Keep trying, get extra help when you need it, and also recognize the effort you are putting in. Be proud of the small accomplishments, that acts as motivation for larger ones. You‚Äôre doing great and there are people who are so proud of you, even if you aren‚Äôt yet proud of yourself.",ogh09,3
3067,2024-08-22 05:11:10,64,"My sincere advice to you is to focus on completing your degree and not worrying about your GPA.    My employers have never asked for transcripts, and only ever asked for proof of diploma.",CharlieLeDoof,2
3068,2024-08-22 05:11:10,64,"Know that your GPA will not determine your future, I graduated 2 years ago with a very high GPA and I would not say I am in any better of a position than my friends who had GPAs closer to yours. I am not a therapist, but I feel that your issue isn‚Äôt a lack of motivation or desire to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù in college, it sounds like you care a whole lot about your education which is a good thing, but it isn‚Äôt everything. I think maybe you are putting so much pressure on yourself that you are starting to crack, especially since you aren‚Äôt sharing your struggles.

It can be very scary and intimidating, but I would recommend talking to those close to you, family, friends, SO. You don‚Äôt have to talk to all of them at once or anything, but the people you put around you are supposed to be a part of a support system. For me I always made sure to let my GF know what is going on even if I didn‚Äôt want my family or friends to know. Asking Reddit for help is a start, but hearing it from someone you love is different. I know talking to someone so close to you can seem scary because we value what they think so much, but I have found that when I open up I usually don‚Äôt get the negative reaction that I invented in my head and instead I receive the love and support I needed. You know your own family better than I do, but saying these things out loud can be a huge weight off your shoulders and help you move forward. 

Therapy is also a great tool because it allows you to talk to someone you don‚Äôt have to interact with otherwise, and they are actually trained to help unlike all of us redditors. I started Therapy my junior year and it helped me a lot at the end of college when I was spiraling. If you are interested feel free to DM me and I can share the information of my therapist near Ann Arbor, she really is amazing. The school itself is also happy to connect you with a therapist, even ones who don‚Äôt work for the school.",bwish327,2

Over the next few weeks, there will be a ton of on campus events with free food and swag. Try to check out whatever you can. Take the blue bus to north campus (or central) and explore for a few hours.

The big difference is that you‚Äôll have strict time and memory constraints for your projects, make sure you know how to avoid memory leaks, do your best to avoid using unnecessary time or memory, and don‚Äôt code everything under main, make other classes and functions. There‚Äôs also debugging tools you‚Äôll be introduced to which can help out.

There are a lot of overlaps between stats and DS programs with more emphasis on fleshing out the DS program further. UofM is highly ranked in both programs (last I recall T10 or T15) so you cannot go wrong with either.

Canada goose (and many other parkas) are very warm because they dump a ton of relatively low-quality down into the jacket, which ultimately means you get a heavy, bulky, overpriced product that is admittedly great for keeping warm. ¬†You‚Äôll see the same out of the TNF McMurdo or Fjallraven Nuuk (synthetic fill on the latter), both of which cost less than a quarter as much as an expedition.

The added caveat is that parkas like these may well be overkill for most of the winter, especially if you‚Äôre going to be walking everywhere.

Your best bet is to bite the bullet and look for tickets from a secondary source as people are always selling tickets.

Alumni status gives some priority points when tickets go on sale but not much in itself to be of use.  You could check if the alumni association has any allotment left but that is also unlikely for a game like this and you would probably need to be a member (which you may be because I think they give a one-year membership to recent graduates).

My sight reading was horrible at the time but I made it through. Then you have a short discussion with the exec team to meet them.

I also want to mention that even if someone doesn't get accepted upon their first audition, they are encouraged to try again as many times as they like in future semesters. I've known several incredible singers that weren't accepted for their first try but went on to join the group and do great things.

Not just anywhere in Michigan; local communities have to specifically authorize their use on public roads. To my knowledge, neither Ann Arbor nor the University of Michigan have done so. A couple dozen small communities have, but no mid-sized or large cities.

I've seen them used in Naples FL, where they're well suited to retirees who just want to drive a few blocks in quiet residential neighborhoods to nearby destinations. However, they're regularly involved in fatal accidents involving younger people, One fatal accident last year had 9 people in the golf cart, one died and 8 injured, while in a freak accident, a 21-year-old was fatally crushed by a golf cart in her parent's garage.

I studied information science. Graduated in 2019 with a bachelors, and focused on ux research + academic research. I‚Äôve found my analytical skills I learned from professors to help me a lot in my roles but be difficult to translate to roles. Mainly; I spent about a year being a research grunt under one professor about human computer interaction and how humans personalities interact with robots. Got me published and I thought the work was cool but it absolutely does not pay back my student loans or translate well to corporate roles I‚Äôve discovered early in my career, so I had to pivot and pivot hard. I started at ford after college as a product manager then went software engineer and then manufacturing engineer and then got fired after 2 years (I was in their rotational program thing). I was so bored and kept getting in petty fights in company wide group chats that only became possible after Covid (ford used to use skype for business which limited company wide communications to 50 or less people, and transitioned to WebEx which had 1000+ group chats). 

After I got fired I self taught myself swift to create iOS apps. Got one published on the App Store and got absolutely swamped by recruiters after I put that I published an iOS app on my resume. Then I got hired to build mobile apps for a Texas solar energy company. Got fired from that role after a year and now 7 months of being unemployed ford is asking me to come back for $80-90/hr and I keep saying no bc I don‚Äôt want to commute to Dearborn from where I live (Oakland county). I‚Äôm confused, and unemployed, but get TOns of recruiters so it‚Äôs hard for me to gauge what the hell to do. Airbnb and Robinhood reached out to me for iOS dev roles last week and I‚Äôm interviewing with robinhood now. I see comments here saying how the job market is bad, but‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt feel too bad for me right now idk. 

This was a rant, but I am in the process of applying to masters programs (in Germany or Poland bc way cheaper and I want to move) that focus on CS or more coding since I chose not to focus on that much while at UMSI. There‚Äôs a ton of python coding courses in UMSI and entire ‚Äúinformation analysis‚Äù pathways and people go into the same roles as the CS grads I‚Äôve noticed. I also wonder about the faculty : student ratio in the classes for UMSI and CS. Most classes had a 60 (student) : 2 (GSI) : 1 (professor) ratio which felt nice.

3468,2024-08-19 15:58:38,9,"Hey! Sorry in advance for the essay hehehe

I originally was math with a cs minor, but then I switched the minor to a major (back when you didn‚Äôt have to apply for the major, definitely got lucky) my senior year. Junior year, I had a math internship, and didn‚Äôt start considering CS jobs until I was halfway through my internship and realized I didn‚Äôt like it. I graduated in 2023, so when I was looking for jobs, the general sentiment surrounding the market was pretty similar, people were struggling to get interviews and callback amid many tech layoffs.

My experience was pretty standard, had some interviews get cancelled, never heard back from a majority of companies I applied to, but in the end I did end up getting a couple offers at companies I liked.

With regards to how competitive the job market is, anecdotally, it will be similar across the different CS related degrees, since everyone can apply to any other job (most job descriptions say ‚Äúrelated field‚Äù or something similar). 

It sounds like you‚Äôve made your mind on pursuing programming to some extent, so the question should be what do you enjoy more? I really liked GPU programming for example, and hated the front end work of 485. So I made sure to stay away from front end related classes and jobs.

3475,2024-08-19 15:58:38,9,"Depends what you want. 

I think UMSI grads get lots of product manager, database admin, info/business analyst, intelligence, API developer, and consultant roles or they go hardcore down the academia/research/librarian path. 
Lots of the professors have computer science or electrical engineering degrees in the program. The school of information used to be ‚Äúthe school of library science‚Äù and the BSI program is in a weird spot bc in order to get a librarian job you have to have MLS degree, which is a grad program and they offer. There‚Äôs also not a lot of formal librarian jobs out there, but there‚Äôs still lots of companies willing to pay for students trained by librarians on how to perform research for specific hypothesis‚Äî which is why the UMSI ‚Äî> ux research/design pipeline is so strong, since that‚Äôs what those folks do. 

These are all just my opinions and I second guess my choice to go to UMSI a lot. Always go through the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù about if I went to an art and design school, if I studied business instead, or studied CS in undergrad.

If you really want to drill down into it, you can look at the employment reports for the programs. UMSI and the School of Engineering publish these.

3488,2024-08-19 15:58:38,9,"Yes, you are correct there is a ton of overlap in the types of jobs graduates from CS or UMSI students go to. I was speaking specifically about info jobs, as jobs (descriptions or titles) that have more info/data-oriented roles. There tend to be more UMSI students who go into more traditional CS jobs than CS students who go into info-related positions.

I do not have the per capita info grads to info jobs to give a more accurate assessment. But there are more traditional CS jobs than info jobs and CS students (especially from UMich's program) tend to be placed into the positions much easier. If you leave UMSI without above average in terms of coding ability info student, it drastically narrows your employment opportunities as you are mostly picking from the very small field of info jobs.

It's a sloppy assessment by any real rigor I will admit, but seems to fit what I've seen in many info students here, I know someone who hasn't been able to get an info job for over a year and I know quite a few who just ended up in IT (which neither CS or info degree were required).",_iQlusion,1

So if you're taking 9 credit hours that's 9 hours of lecture + 27 hours of homework and studying + 40 hours of employment for 76 hours of work per week. That's feasible but you are gonna be pretty busy for those couple of years.

Someone with Covid might exhale 10 million to 200 million copies of the virus per hour.^(1) Quantification of filtration effects within a room are subject to many factors, and lingering air in pockets of the a suggest multiple filters would be advised.^(2) But even if you remove 90% of the viral particles per hour, new ones are being generated as long as the roommate is present and still breathing.

I think you'd be better served by using a window fan to blow some of the viral load outside or into your hallway, increasing other peoples' risks, but reducing your own. But even then, a particularly infectious respiratory virus will try to gain a foothold in you.

If you want more significant protection I'd suggest dividing the space into a green zone and red zone with some plastic sheeting painter-taped to the walls, ceiling, and floor, and keeping viral intrusion out of the green zone through positive pressure, blowing air into your section directly through a window, or with an air hose from the contaminated section to your section connected to a window that's otherwise sealed to prevent contaminated air from exiting the window. Ingress and egress will expose you to increased risk, but you can increase PPE precautions and follow disinfection protocols following controlled exposures.

3683,2024-08-17 05:47:52,40,"It BAFFELS me when people cannot see the nuance of what is and has been happening in that region since the state of Israel's inception. Not only has Israel been documented to historicaly incite atrocities in that region since the time of Ben-Gurion (plan Dalet for instance), there is also a measured effort to constantly revise borders between Israel and palestine in favor of Israel. 

All the while, Gaza remains an open air prison where families have been separated for at least a generation, Gazan's movement within the region is restricted, Gazan's are constantly harassed by Israeli occupant settlers, and the resources allowed into Gaza and the west bank are so heavily restricted by Israel that the quality of life is markedly worse across the board. Not to mention that Israel has bombarded Gaza constantly both with and without instigation from Hamas. 

What the fuck does Israel expect when they treat people like animals, they will most likely end up bitten in some way. 

So while I do not agree with Hamas in its entirety, I see this as a question of what other option do Gazans have? Who else will step in to defend Palestine when it has been under attack since the inception of the Israeli state in 1948. 

Additionally, many of the Iran backed terrorist cells in that region were formed in direct response to Israeli assaults on that region. Hezbollah and Hamas being the most noteworthy. In the same way that America creates many of its own problems for the gain of profit (hello taliban), isrsel does the same for similar reasons.

Jewishness should not hinge on Israeli nationalism, all nationalism does is incite violence and make the Jewish diaspora less safe globally. There is a measured and calculated effort to convince jews to ""come home"" so that an ethno-nationalist ""utopia"" can exist in a war torn region while the US swims in Billions of dollars of Israeli debt and weapons sales.

What the admin should have physical removed them at the beginning? Those protesters were threatened with arrests and they didn't move. No way giving them a fine would have discouraged them. You also have to identify the people to give them fines and when most of them are wearing masks, you'd have to physically stop them and demask them or hope they self identify.

Most professors do not have time or energy to train new RAs from scratch and would prefer to hire someone with relevant skills, especially if they are paying for your salary. In fact, freshman/sophomore research positions are rare apart from rare advanced candidates (taking PhD level coursework or starting with advanced courses from the get go) or disciplines that require a lot of grunt work (ex: natural science labs etc.) or with fewer technical skills (ex: humanities where you read and summarize/analyze documents)

As such, first thing you should do is take some classes that are related to research fields you are targeting (ex: for economics, take at an econometrics course, know linear models, and know some statistical programming, in fact for most applied quantitative disciplines statistical programming is a must). Taking a class from that professor and doing well is also a good way to get research opportunities since professor will get a understanding of your capabilities

For an anecdote, I got my first RA position by emailing a professor whose class I had already taken when I was in-between my undergraduate and masters at UofM. Later on, I got my current full time research position by doing well in a class and getting referral (instructor vouching for me) for another professor looking for an RA.

**In the end, at large top-tier research institutions like UofM, professors have a lot of qualified candidates (especially graduate students) to assist with their research and do not want to waste funds and time on undergraduate students that they have to train from scratch if they can help it. Also: they got lots of mails so sorting through generic cold emails becomes annoying. One thing you can do is to do well in courses and work on technical skills needed for your research area of interest (in your case statistical programming in R or Python) and take core classes that are helpful to research areas you are interested in. If you end up emailing cold emails, at least research professors research areas and whether they had RAs assisting them before (ex: do not email a theorist with all solo papers and no RA credit for a position).**

I did the most work on the team and it was quite disappointing to see us make hardly any progress. It also wasn't clear what the professor's expectations for the project were. He never told us what we had to do for an A, and he didn't even tell us what goals to work towards with our research (thereby encouraging my team to be lazy). I also joined MDP so that I could secure something to do during the summer, but they only gave 2 out of 15 people in our group a chance to join for the summer, so from this aspect MDP isn't useful.

That is my own experience. I've spoken to friends and they also experienced similar issues with having a lazy professor and not getting much out of the project. However, the seminars the MDP director puts on are quite useful, and perhaps if I had a better team I would have enjoyed it more. Some other people in my group had a better team and got more done, and it seems like they all enjoyed the project.

To conclude, MDP is quite hit or miss. If you are looking for research experience I would recommend reaching out directly to professors who will give you more challenging and interesting research. I have friends who did that and they all had a much better research experience.",Forsaken_Round9441,3

However, I will say that, as someone who has worked at U-M in various roles and multiple departments: if you're ""thinking about applying"", then just apply and consider the pros and cons only after you've been invited for an interview at the earliest. The volume of quality applications received for any given position, especially those unrelated to a specific academic field, is so high that many good applicants don't receive much consideration. It sucks, but it is what it is. Getting a job at U-M comes to down to some combination of a) being a particularly strong and clear fit for the position, b) applying for a pretty large volume of positions, and c) luck (which may or may not include nepotism). You don't need to hit on all three of these, but your odds of getting an interview are low if you don't hit on at least one or two.

  
So, TL;DR - if the position looks like something you really want to do, regardless of department culture, then just apply and see if anything comes of it. If you really want to work for U-M in general, then apply to as many positions as you can that fit your wants and needs.

For example, the student legal services fees go to that office to fund their work.  As for tuition, that gets split between all the units where a student takes classes--so if a Social Work student takes a class in LSA and another in the Law school, LSA & Law each get some of the tuition the Social work student is charged.  So if Social Work hires one of their student to be a GSI, they can't just say ""oh, we'll just waive your tuition & fees and not collect the revenue"" because it's not all their revenue to forego.  They'd be taking revenue away from student legal services, from Law, from LSA, each of whom aren't gaining anything from the hire.

I jumped in first semester freshman year with that two year break and it went fine for me. I was definitely a little behind the other students for the first few weeks just because everything was rusty but I felt like I definitely caught up within a few weeks and I don't think  it impacted my final grade in the class at all. 

I will also say that looking back I am shocked I got placed into 231 at all, because as I said when I took the placement exam I had not taken Spanish in two years and I only had taken 2 years of high school Spanish. My friend I made in the class had taken 4 years of high school Spanish and got the same placement and seemed more on par with the other students. So you may not even feel as behind as I did in the beginning.

I would also remember that regardless of where you start the endpoint will always be the same, so if you go backwards from where they say you can start you really are just paying the university thousands of dollars to do so.",twinwhoreddits,1

We live in abundance, so we never have to worry about going hungry. We throw away food too easily because we've lost sight of its value. This problem persists throughout our entire culture.¬† It may be more overtly obvious in frat house trash, but it's the same story at every restaurant, dining hall, and retailer.


The best way to combat this is to be mindful of the food waste you create. Think about what you're buying, eat/cook what you have, and if at a dining hall or restaurant, don't order more than you'll eat. Do your best to not create food that will only go to a dumpster to rot.

i love everything except AP/IB doesn‚Äôt count for registration. that makes it hard to get some upper level classes if you don‚Äôt have a lot of university or transfer credits.

Just try to remember that college is so much more about classes. Tbh you could learn most of that online today. What you can‚Äôt get online is meeting new people and getting new experiences. I know this is a lot but it‚Äôs something I wish someone would‚Äôve told me as a new student.",jepherry,5

The lab wait-lists are so strict because they are limited by equipment / lab stations and the instructors are literally not allowed to let in more people. With lectures they can override and temporarily overbook, knowing that a bunch will drop. But labs don't have extra stations / equipment for the first few weeks before people drop.

Id say even with you being so close to the top at rank 2 you probably have maybe a 40% chance.

Now if this was a lecture with discussion groups and even if you were rank 8 or 9 you could get in most of the time. Heck I've gotten in at position 17 on wait-list for lectures/discussion lmao.

Since most PhD programs try to ensure full support, many of those students will still get \*something\* (maybe a GSRA if not a GSI).  Over time, programs will continue to adjust their pedagogy and may admit smaller PhD cohorts so it won't matter that there are fewer GSI openings.

If your PI is constantly leaning over you and breathing heavy in the lab, that's not a union issue but a university issue. If your PI's management style involves screaming and throwing things, that's again the university rather than the union. Even more benign problems such as an insufficiently invested PI aren't union issues. These issues are both important and, more critically, not something you can reasonably know before signing up for 4 - 6 years of your life.

In contrast, your pay/benefits/hours/etc. are something you know before you set foot on campus. Even if they never change during your 4 - 6 years in the program, they were still sufficient for you to attend the university in the first place.

For simple graduate students - who are gone in an eye blink - it's especially strange to be discontented with wages/benefits that they felt were perfectly fine the year before.

From my personal experience, the graduate student's union at Michigan was of no value. If the university had not offered market rates for the role upfront, I would have simply gone elsewhere.",ViskerRatio,1

Learning how to code an ML model/system is also important apart from the theories. You can find good resources about PyTorch here (https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection)",StillSalad1265,2

4402,2024-08-10 23:33:57,0,"Usually the first lecture, just show up and ask the professor. Override depends on the course size and the type of course. 

If it is a large lecture course with discussions, professors usually don't handle waitlist, they leave it to the sectional GSIs. So show up to the discussion section you are waitlisted in and talk to the GSI. 

If it is a seminar kind of course, professors are more flexible to give override as long as the class size permits (going 5-6 more ppl sounds fine but more than 15 sounds like a lot to them). 

But if your class has some sort of lab, field trip or outdoor activities. There might be a cap for enrollment simply because there wont be enough equipment or resource for everyone.

4407,2024-08-10 20:59:44,33,"Mojo usually had the best variety of food and were consistently similar for each weekly rotation. Most days they offer some form of chicken (and other meats occasionally), and most of those days the chicken is tender. They also have decent mushroom beef burgers where you can tack on lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc on your own. Salad bar was always really good and fruit selection was mostly decent.

South quad had unique dishes occasionally, but most days I found them just okay, enough to get by since they're one of the two closest to the Ugli (granted I've only ate there past 4pm). Their deserts are often amazing though!

East quad was pretty limited in options (their dining hall is small) but they had very decent food and it's all prepared for you. There's still a personal salad bar though (if I'm remembering this right lol).

Heard good things about markeley for the french toast and self-made pizzas, never got around to trying it.

If you ever end up going to north, burseley is okay. Their salad bar and fruit selection is great, but their protein options are ass. Often lacking and it's mostly a form of carbs with very little, if any, meat. This winter semester they seem to have almost completely stopped making burgers (basically their sole good protein source) and just had pizzas, pasta, and some soups (soups were nice). Breakfast foods were somehow consistently going past 12pm so getting a differing lunch was a little frustrating.

I think it would have been better for him to say that he was challenging himself to go from ‚Äúnothing to something‚Äù, or maybe marketing the page as a social experiment to show that even someone with literally nothing but a few dollars and ambition can still find a way around. But labeling it as ‚Äúhomelessness‚Äù, though not entirely inaccurate, is disingenuous because he CAN opt out whenever he wants to. The very real people struggling with homelessness have no fallback like that.

I do have to say though, his constant grind to find work is admirable. Although I‚Äôm not really sure why he declined a paint job for $20/hr during a phone call with his friend (I think it was the Day 5 video), it‚Äôs still commendable to be constantly looking for things to do for work rather than begging or acting entitled to a well paying job, or like you said, using resources explicitly for struggling homeless people.

(Edit: But then again, that also sets a precedent of ‚Äúwell if this kid can do it, why can‚Äôt everyone else?‚Äù Which ignores some key social issues that lead to homelessness in the first place.)

It is a very volatile environment as people are often in crisis and/or emergency situations. Many people come and go quickly and in the time that I stayed in one I saw many, many people who would leave because they would rather live in the tent city we had nearby than in the homeless shelter. I watched some of this kids videos and yea - he's choosing safe spots he can sleep mostly in peace and is least likely to be disturbed which is like what I did at his age (although I wasn't homeless by choice).

CSG is the least efficient means of solving the problems that they are trying to fix. Those dollars would be more efficiently spent in the hands they take them from. It's just silly to think about it, CSG gets a large portion of their funding from students who take out loans on behalf of CSG. CSG essentially gets money that other people have to pay significant interest rates on so CSG can act in the most performative ways.

* they aren't a U-M student at all
* their current registration status doesn't permit library use (for example, they aren't enrolled this term and for some reason not on ""detached study"" status)
* they aren't a student at one of the institutions with whom we have standing alliances/borrowing relationships.

I see reddit requests for library materials with some frequency, most times from outsiders whose institutions don't provide the same level of resources that U-M does.  U-M invests substantially in its libraries and it's one of the amazing privileges of being here--it's just something we don't think about because it's seamless for us.  Library resources are not cheap and many institutions have been forced to make very hard choices about what subscriptions and services to keep access to.  Their students and scholars thus bump up against painful roadblocks.  Some of these can be resolved through interlibrary loan but I think for some users it's just faster to get some helpful rando to snag the PDF rather than fill out the form and wait for a librarian to get to the request.

It is also the case that U-M has made some hard choices and I am sure the librarians here would tell you they could do even more if more resources were allocated.  But at the end of the day we are way, way better off than many peers and U-M is one of a shrinking number of libraries that is a resource of last resort for students and scholars at other places.

4566,2024-08-09 05:19:42,10,"It is not strange. It is in fact the position the university ‚Äî and all institutions, really, with holdings ‚Äî instructs us to adopt. 

That open access is managed by institutional links. The university specifically instructs us to not share resources limited to university users with outsiders. They should instead work through their university or contact our institution themselves. 

We as users are not stewards of that policy - there are professionals working for the library system who determine those questions of access when contacted. That is their job and it is their unique field of intervention.

Edit: I work in archives, so I‚Äôll give you some examples. 

Some material is considered related to state secrets (think research into electronics or nuclear engineering.) That‚Äôs clearly not the case here, but it‚Äôs the most visible reason that the archivists and librarians are the ones entrusted with managing open access policies. 

Some material is protected because of legal conditions attached to donations or other forms of acquiring the holdings. 

This is a PhD thesis written by a previous student, and it‚Äôs in linguistics, so it doesn‚Äôt fall under those conditions. There are also rarer situations that do, in fact, happen - this person could be stalking the author and going through their writings to see if they‚Äôve done field research to identify where they‚Äôve worked or been.

Just looking at the syllabus and textbook (I've actually read a bit of it before), this isn't really ""applied"" in the sense that you'd be designing algorithms for real world problems or anything, but more ""applied to other areas of math,"" in particular PDEs, which in fact essentially requires expertise on functional analysis anyway. Things of the nature of using the contraction mapping theorem to establish existence/uniqueness of solutions to ODE systems. So it'd be right up your alley if you're fond of theory. 

I can't speak to the pedagogy of the professor, but she seems rather accomplished. She also seems to be Swiss, and my experience with Swiss-educated math profs at umich, though small in sample size, has been one of confusion due to their different conventions and whatnot.",AdEarly3481,1

I've heard very brutal stories about 217, so it's great that you're preparing right now. Because of this, you should definitely consider 217 this semester and 286 next semester -- not at the same time. Or flip flopped ofc. 

If you're in the mindset of ""I just need linear algebra credit"" take 214. It's much much easier than 217. I've also taken 156 and 285 (both honors) and without bias, they are much more accessible than 116 and 215.

At that point you might as well get an orange permit and then take a bus from that lot to CCTC (central campus transit center which is right next to your building). The nice part about orange lots is that they all have bus stops next to them. 

TLDR if you foresee yourself wanting to park after hours in the blue lot near your building and it being worth the $100+ for you get the yellow/after hours, otherwise get the orange",Average_cs_major,5

4695,2024-08-07 17:33:47,3,"PhD students without funding get dibs on GSI positions first, regardless of their skill because the university guarantees their funding. Professors are always going to go to bat to get their PhD students into better positions too. 

After that you always have the disadvantage against nepotism. Most people aren't going to gamble on someone they don't know when they know someone personally who will at least doing a decent job. It's just a life fact.

Doing well in a class or working hard in research doesn't directly translate to teaching. Networking is a skill you need to learn. When I was a masters student, I got my GSI position because I was good friends with the professor (I also got selected for other positions by just cold applying but turned them down). I also selected my replacement and I also got 2 undergrads TA positions who would unlikely would have got selected as the professor typically gets hundreds of students applying. If you aren't networking at a school with one of the largest alumni populations in the world, you really aren't taking full advantage of your time here.",_iQlusion,31
4696,2024-08-07 17:33:47,3,"Hey,

It‚Äôs a valid concern, and you‚Äôre not alone in feeling this way. Politics can indeed play a role in many decision-making processes, including who gets selected as a GSI. It‚Äôs not uncommon for decisions to be influenced by factors beyond just hard work and merit, such as networking, favoritism, and even timing.

While it‚Äôs frustrating to see seemingly less effort rewarded, it‚Äôs important to remember that multiple factors can affect these decisions. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the system is entirely broken, but it does highlight the complexities and sometimes unfair aspects of the selection process.

Keep pushing forward, stay focused on your goals, and continue to build connections. Over time, your efforts and persistence are likely to pay off.

Best of luck!",CCCOrange,24
4697,2024-08-07 17:33:47,3,"TLDR: Yes, the GSI selection criteria is opaque and there can be politics involved. Yes, sometimes the students that work hardest do not get the position while for some the opportunity drops into their lap without much effort. For better or worse, the GSI system is the way it is because the skills needed for the position are not the same as the ones required for being a good student or researcher. Soft skills are be vital and for small courses having a pre-existing rapport with the instructor matter as it helps the course operate more smoothly. Finally, the GSI positions are never guaranteed unless you are a PhD student and being a GSI a necessity for your funding. As others pointed out, keep working hard and eventually your efforts will be rewarded whether it is a GSI position with tuition waiver, a high paying industry job, or a good post-doc/tenure track position that fits your interests.

1. **For better or worse, the politics are a necessary component of the process as in smaller/advanced courses**, GSIs are mostly autonomous and design the labs on their own. An instructor needs to be able to get along with the GSI, trust in their abilities, and be able to rely on them during emergencies (ex: professor is sick and needs someone to teach a class under short notice). It is not uncommon to see a professors own students get GSI positions for their class as usually the research areas overlap (i.e., if a student is focusing on experimental design and working with a professor working on experimental design, they might be shortlisted and given preference to teach an experimental design course). Furthermore, some professors want to keep the same GSI for the course to make the process easy or reward hard work (example: GSIs that design labs for a course might be preferred to give the course consistency and reward hard work of the GSI)
2. **Soft skills are as important as hard skills for GSI positions.** GSIs teach material, head discussions, grade assignments, and are usually required to communicate with students. Under these circumstances, sometimes soft skills can take precedence over hard skills. You might outperform your peers in courses, in your research, and other fields but if they are better communicators, especially verbal communicators, they might be chosen over you as a GSI since depending on the course, most of the position is communicating. This is another reason why not every researcher makes a good instructor and vice versa. Some people are naturally better at explaining complicated concepts simply or captivate a room full of students or not loose their temper when students ask the same question 1000th time in the same office hour instead of paying attention to other students' questions. These skills can be acquired through practice, but just like sports there are some who are natural at this.
3.  (**I am not sure if the OP is a masters or a PhD student) GSI positions are not a right, they are a privilege unless you are PhD student**. In US universities master's programs are usually cash-cows where students pay for a education credential, this is in contrast with Europe where master's programs are usually research focused, akin to first 2 years of a PhD program in US. Since master's programs generate revenue, most programs do not give GSI positions to master's students if they can help it. (GSI=tuition waiver=loss of tuition revenue). PhD students already have their education paid for so a tuition waiver is not a loss of revenue and depending on the department, most PhD students are required to GSI for a set number of semesters per their funding offer. Some get fellowships and GSRA positions instead of GSI positions but most are required to GSI. The specifics change between fields and departments but the point stands that PhD students have priority for GSI positions and they also have 1-on-1 relationship with professors as their advisors, committee members, co-authors etc. as such will always be in a better place to snatch the open positions",RunningEncyclopedia,4
4698,2024-08-07 17:33:47,3,"I‚Äôve heard the new labor contract for GSIs/GSSAs has had a massive impact on school budgets. If you‚Äôre not a PhD student who was guaranteed funding or a graduate student in that school, the odds of you getting a spot this year are slim. Outside of that, yes, there‚Äôs very much a political process in gaining a spot. I‚Äôd wager even more so now with contract restraints. 

Many of us are in the same boat as you. Do your best to build good relationships with professors now so that you might have a shot in the Winter.

4699,2024-08-07 17:33:47,3,Yes for sure there are also departmental politics at play.

In another case, a student actually had to repeat a core course (I didn't realize this could even happen in a graduate program), and yet somehow ended up getting a GSI appointment the next semester. I even had teaching experience, but never got the opportunity. Still a little salty about it to this day- sure, I wasn't entitled to a position, but if the people they are selecting are...not great at it, it makes my omission a bit harder to swallow.

4702,2024-08-07 17:33:47,3,"Absolutely. We had a situation in the urban planning program a year or two ago where two very qualified students of color were passed over for white students. One of the white students had no experience whatsoever in the subject matter. 

They students of color who were passed over were told that it was because they had already had a gsi appointment and were ineligible to be hired as gsi‚Äôs again. But one of the white students who received the appointment over the poc applicants already had two gsi appointments. And of course the white without any experience student who received an appointment over the poc student with 10 years of industry experience served no purpose to the students and failed to do the bare minimum in their role.

4728,2024-08-07 03:43:56,4,"Do you have relevant skills? Economics research, unlike other disciplines, has a higher barrier of entry as the grunt work is minimal at worst you need to clean vast swaths of data in a statistical programming language (STATA is the most popular followed by R/Python but some still use matlab). You need a good grasp of regression and most likely some fundamental estimators/methdos like IV, Diff&Diff and regression in discontinuity. Finally, making publishable graphs and figures is also time consuming and requires some familiarity with software.

I‚Äôd say, if you have already not done so, focus on learning a statistical programming language and take the ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù (ECON 451/452) sequence and learn R (Stats 316) or Python (UM coursera) at least to signal to these professors you have the skills to be an RA.

4817,2024-08-06 15:50:36,21,"I'm a premed applying in the current cycle. I never even considered applying for HSSP. I can assure you that being a premed is not a matter of being in a certain program. There is no lost ""clout"" for not getting accepted into HSSP or UROP or a med frat or a living community. Adcoms simply don't care about these types of things; they care more about your academic strength, your experiences, and your story.

Here is the advice I would have given myself at the beginning of college:  
-Start extracurriculars EARLY. Longitudinal experience is so valuable. Go for depth over breadth. Find a clinical experience as soon as possible if you can. EMT is a popular one that can be balanced around a school schedule. I'm currently working as an MA during my gap years, and I love it. I wish I had started earlier. If you choose the MA route, I recommend looking into private practices over larger hospital systems (you get to do way more hands-on stuff, and private practices care less about whether you are certified).   
-Get those volunteer hours up. I HIGHLY recommend trying to do something to help the underserved. Find a position where you are physically interacting with the people you are helping. You will have much more meaningful experiences than if you were just restocking supplies in a hospital (that's what I did).

-Find a research experience. Yes, advisors will tell you it is not a hard requirement to get into med school. But if you ask me, it is a soft requirement. If you in the lucky 20% or so of applicants who have a publication, it can be a make or break in your application. I don't have one, but I had multiple posters and wrote a thesis. UROP is a good place to start, otherwise cold email or...  
-Talk to your professors. This is one of my biggest regrets!!! I never really struggled in class so I didn't bother going to office hours, but tbh that's not the point. Make them remember you. You will need letters of recommendation from professors and I STRUGGLED because I never spoke to any of them. Plus, you never know if a professor is looking for a student to work in their lab...

-CRAFT A NARRATIVE THROUGH YOUR EXPERIENCES. Mental health was a big theme in my personal statement and one of my reasons for being a doctor is because I want to help reduce the stigma against seeking mental help. BUT, now I realize that none of my experiences actually reflected this desire. I did a lot of research experiences and random volunteering clubs, but I never did anything to prove I was actually committed to what I was saying. As a result I'm finding it a lot more difficult to write my story. In other words, try to find a common thread that connects your experiences.

-Other things you will want to have on your application: leadership, shadowing, teaching experience (TA, peer facilitator, tutor, etc), 1 or 2 unique hobbies, and maybe some form of social justice/advocacy (it is a new category they just added to AMCAS). The most important things to have are definitely clinical experience, research, and clinical/non-clinical volunteering though.

-Above all, prioritize your grades. GPA and MCAT are, for better or worse, the keys that will get you through the door. Aim for perfection, but I'd say at least a 3.8 GPA and a 516 MCAT if you want to be comfortably competitive for a T25 med school. 

  
Sorry I realize that was a lot of info you didn't really ask for. But I want to assure you that you absolutely do not need HSSP to be a successful premed. No disrespect intended, but you aren't missing out on anything, I promise. There is so much work that goes into this journey but the resources are there, you just need to keep your eyes open and your head up. You are more than welcome to contact me for specific advice, I would like to help you!",taojay1,41

In regards to the first thing, who is the University? How does the University differ from a staff or faculty member? I believe the office that houses the statement of student rights and responsibilities (the office of student conflict resolution) will be weaponized to bring forward complaints that align with interests of those in power. This will further erode trust with a student resource that seeks to resolve conflict in restorative and peaceful ways. It also pushes against the philosophy of restorative justice that instead of asking what rule was broken and who should be punished, asks who was harmed and who has a responsibility to repair that harm?

And to give 7 days to resolve conflict through the office of student conflict resolutions number one requested resource is a bit insulting, especially when 45 days is given to an adversarial hearing process. Conflict resolution takes time and often isnt a linear process.

For your resume, make sure to include any work or leadership experience with transferable skills (technical or soft skills). The [Engineering Career Resource Center](https://career.engin.umich.edu/how-we-can-help/) (ECRC) and [University Career Center](https://careercenter.umich.edu/) (UCC) both have resume resources on their respective website, and you can also sign up for one-on-one resume reviews through ECRC. 

Before the fair, be sure to prepare an elevator pitch when talking to recruiters during which you introduce yourself, talk a little about your experiences and how they relate to the specific company, and ask the recruiter either about the position you're interested in or what their job is. 

On a similar note, remember to do your research beforehand! Know what companies you want to visit on the day of the fair and be prepared to wait in lines for more popular companies. It may be worth your time to visit some smaller companies first to get used to talking to recruiters and to maximize the number of people you make contact with. If you want to see what year/major companies are recruiting, log into [12twenty](https://engin-umich.12twenty.com/events#/events), scroll down to the ""Fall Engineering Career Fair"" event, click on the ""Employers"" tab, then choose the company you're interested in.

4934,2024-08-05 04:14:58,7,"Former MFRM (I usually call it Fin Math) major here! I graduated in 2022 with a BS in economics, statistics and MFRM and went onto a masters in statistics through AMDP (Accelerated Master's Degree Program, i.e. 4+1 masters)

**Positives:** MFRM is a nice major that gives you a solid background in quantitative finance, especially with regards to pricing of financial instruments. It is a niche major (you are still a math major technically it is a concentration) but has a wide range of possible career prospects, with the most lucrative being quant finance where some get 6 figure salaries right out of college. Finally, the major has a lot of overlap with statistics (entire statistics pre-requisite and 425-426 theory requirement for statistics) and somewhat with economics (you need to take econ 101-02 and can count 401-402 distributional electives for the major) so double or even triple majoring is quite easy. Finally, the major feeds nicely into the AMDP program (Quantitative Finance and Risk Management for math track and Applied Statistics if you supplement it with statistics major)  


**Negatives:** That being said, when I went through the major (and I believe still currently) the major is really theoretical with a lot of fixed costs for taking any remotely applied course. Just to take MATH 423, a course primarily on pricing options, you need Math 115,116,215,217 and 425. Furthermore, most of your coursework is theoretical. This is somewhat an artefact of quantitative finance where the models are continuously refined (for example a ARMA-GARCH model with asymmetric and heavy tailed error distribution would be a considered simple even though non of the components of the model are trivial, especially estimation) and the field is very top heavy with a lot of math geniuses (ex: students taking PhD level coursework sophomores/juniors) or PhD holders dominating the field. This makes going through the AMDP track a near necessity if you want to go forward with a quant position in the industry. Finally, like all other math tracks, the coursework can get time consuming and difficult at times with a lot of variance due to most courses (in the math department, not the electives/requirements from other departments) being taught by post-docs that are here for 2-3 years (I had one or two courses during my entire major that were from full time faculty, rest were all post-docs). 

  
**TLDR:** Financial math is an amazing major that provides a solid foundation for quantitative finance and economics as well as statistics. The major works well with economics and statistics majors, giving you flexibility to pursue either of them as a secondary major (even both to triple major!). The major has nice exits in terms of AMDP programs or industry but the coursework is really theoretical so you need internships or other advanced courses to supplement yourself in terms of applied skills. Finally, the coursework can be difficult but if you put time and effort to it you can succeed! Just do not overload your schedule with 5 courses and a half time job like me and truly digest the material.",RunningEncyclopedia,6

Also there is a payment plan option that lets you split up the remaining balance into 6 interest fee payments but it does have a fee to start up. You'd contact financial services (not financial aid) for the payment plan option if you had any balance left over after using up scholarship funds.

If you are a good student, maybe not top 1%, want to have fun, not tied to the midwest, maybe not 100% on being an engineer, then the equation changes. Possibly want to take classes at Ross and/or do banking -- UM may provide better opportunities. And of course you may be neither of the two scenarios.

You also may want to ask your parents, if you don't use all the $$ for UM and pay less for Purdue, can you use the remainder on grad school or a down payment. And maybe be kind to your parents, if they use all their money up  now, maybe they'll be living with  you in their older age :)

CHE 230 is not that bad, and you probably at least have an idea of what Michigan math is like as far as 215 goes if you took any main sequence calc last year.

You can do both of them and fill up the rest with easy requirement classes to get some buffer room. Otherwise, you can prioritize orgo since you need that for biochem later on and many upper levels require some sort of chem prereqs.

You mentioned specifically that you are looking for a MSW.

MSW is fulfilling career with you helping tons of people but unfortunately, like teachers, the reality is that you are not compensated as well compared to your peers in other industry focused programs (MBAs, engineers, statisticians and data scientists, computer scientists...).

As for scholarships: If you get a GSI position your tuition is waived depending on your fraction and you get a salary that is roughly 12-14 thousand for 20 hours; however, as mentioned MSW students already have to do unpaid internships and I am not sure if there is a strong demand for GSIs in School of Social Work.

The field placement is the one thing that makes the whole thing feel worth it (if you get a good one, I‚Äôve heard horror stories)
The SW financial aid office is‚Ä¶questionable. 
I don‚Äôt know how they distribute their scholarships etc but I know of ppl in desperate need who‚Äôve had their aid/scholarships reduced just due to ‚Äúnew packages‚Äù being given out or due to moving to in state tuition (and now they pay more). Whereas other students with less need were accidentally given twice the amount of aid due to a mess up from the FA office and then the AD not just allowing but advocating for them to keep it. (Truly it just seems like you have to get on good terms with her to get a decent package after your first semester - if you appeal or apply for scholarships)

The classes, I think it really depends on what professor you get. Unfortunately RMP and ATLAS don‚Äôt really give enough if any info on the professors so it‚Äôs really a hit or miss. 
The classes are unnecessarily long - 3 hours (sometimes 4) for all of what could fit in 1.5 - 2 hours

I remember being so excited for the program. Maybe it‚Äôs just the overbearing schedule I have due to other things but truly feel like field placement has taught me the most and has been the one thing that‚Äôs made it worth the while (but absolutely NOT worth the cost)

I can't speak for everyone, but in my experience, the School of Social Work has been **very** generous in the amount of aid they've offered me. I wouldn't be doing my MSW here if it weren't for that. Obviously, YMMV with grants and aid depending on your financial circumstances, so don't take my experience as a given, but know that there are resources out there and that the SSW will work with you as much as they can so don't hesitate to be real with them about your financial situation.

There are also [""special programs"" at the SSW](https://ssw.umich.edu/programs/msw/financial-aid/special-programs) you can apply for that will give you additional funding in exchange for taking certain classes and/or doing specific internships. I don't know if they're all this way, but the one I applied and am waitlisted for offers $6k per semester that you don't have to repay.

Outside of that, there's no federal grants or scholarships that I'm aware of at the graduate level. You can apply for private/third party scholarships, of course, but that's going to be legwork you'll have to do. There's work study as well, but that's something you'll have to apply and get approved for based on need.

In terms of FAFSA/student loans, the only thing you'll qualify for at the graduate level are Direct Unsubsidized Loans and/or Graduate PLUS Loans, depending on how much you might have already borrowed as an undergrad. There's no Pell Grants for graduate level.

EDIT: Oh, forgot to mention Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) if it's not something you're already aware of. The program is under stress right now due to the Biden administration and the Supreme Court bickering about loan forgiveness, but it still exists and is something to keep in mind if you're concerned about debt.",big_daddy_energy,1

You might get a few safety first alarms,  the type used for the elderly and toddlers when they are frequent elopers: https://a.co/d/5M5Z896

I'm not trying to worry you more,  but honestly,  I would buy these things for my own kid when she moves out,  especially in any housing situation where any other human has a set of keys to my dwelling. I would be looking at securing every possible entry point. Including windows. 

I would keep a weapon of some sort in every room. But,  I'm not a trusting person. I have a pocket knife and a small axe within reach in my truck, as well as some aerosol cans of battery cleaner that could be used in a punch.... My home is equally convenient to harm intruders. Anything can be a weapon,  but you should feel comfortable with whatever you have. Even an umbrella. Mace, pocket knives,  baseball bats, stun guns, large sticks.... literally anything.  

  I honestly would go Fort Knox, ESPECIALLY after having already experienced a shady encounter. Idk,  peace of mind would be worth every penny to me.

Regarding GSI, as iQlusion mentioned, the new GEO contract made them very expansive to the college. Moreover, some of the ""general classes"" instructorships (I am not sure if German was such) were ""outsourced"" by the respective department to other grad students outside LSA, most notably law students (the main example is the writing classes, outsourced by socio to mainly law students). Because they were hired as GSIs and not adjuncts (god knows why), they got besides salary (which obviously they should get for their teaching times) other benefits, most notably tuition reimbursement. Obviously law tuition is different than regular Rackham grad tuition. That caused major LSA funds to go to other schools (like the law), and we are talking millions of dollars a year.   


This year, LSA has a deficit of tens of millions of dollars (somewhere between 20-40, I am not up to date on the numbers that must have changed throughout the summer). It is one of the main impetuses to the tuition hike by the way. One mitigation LSA chose is to stop hiring external GSIs from other grad programs, which makes total sense to me (nevertheless, socio are freaking out about filling up writing classes, but that's not my problem).

I would say to any grad student at the uni right now, due to the difficulty of dealing with the GEO and their contract (irregardless of the current direction they chose to confront the admins and support terrorism), I would not expect any support in the form of GSI position except what is explicitly written in your offer letter...",1caca1,7

I think you are also a bit delusional about the amounts of money ""saved"" by these moves. Wages for TT AP in STEM range between 80k to 120k, so basically factoring in tuition waivers for GSIs, probably on the lower wages side, for LSA GSIs you have the same cost, for law GSIs, they are probably costlier than TT APs.

5719,2024-07-27 13:17:10,4,"> can you link that bc that sounds insane.

It's common knowledge. Almost all states will not issue driver's licenses (or IDs) to non-state residents. You cannot vote in Michigan unless your legal residence is in the state (and other requirements like you are a US citizen). When you register to vote, you swear to the fact that you are a legal resident of the state. Most likely the state you are from would also declare your state ID or state driver's license as invalid once you declare you are a resident of another state. Almost all states will not allow you to be a legal resident of multiple states at the same time (it creates a nightmare legally for tons of things). 

According to the Dept of State (for Michigan) there is no grace period under state law, so you are legally required to change your ID, vehicle registration, etc once you establish residency in the state. So since you swear to the fact you are a legal resident of the state when registering to vote, it's clear that you have to update your driver's license.

5845,2024-07-24 16:54:22,2,"I took 425-426 sequence for my stats and financial math majors back in 2018-2019. The sequence teaches you fundamental underpinnings of statistical theory that is vital in understanding how statistical estimation works and what are certain tools we have that makes our lives easier (example: ML (Max Likelihood) estimators are asymptotically normal with variance given by inverse of the Fisher Information matrix. Or knowing the distribution approximation to functions of a statistic via the Delta Method). The sequence is analogous to what physics 1-2 is for most engineering disciplines (understanding and learning theory before moving to application).

The sequence is important if you want to move on to graduate school (such theoretical sequences are good signals and help even if stricter version of such courses are still required as you are honing your skills as opposed to building from scratch); however, you will not learn as much practical skills as STATS 413 (regression) or STATS 415 (statistical learning). I would suggest taking it but we vary of what it entails (foundation vs immediately applicable skills)

EDIT to a point I forgot: The sequence is not much helpful for traditional machine learning approaches (minimize a loss function such as squared error or squared error plus l1/2 penalty etc.) but knowing the statistical equivalent to ML approaches and understanding statistics before moving to ML territory can be helpful as statistical models often present a good baseline of what can be done before moving to non-interpretable black box models usually without any possible inference methods",RunningEncyclopedia,4

I‚Äôve always had an interest in Greek life, so I knew I was rushing. I ultimately ended up in the sorority I ranked second, and I while I was initially disappointed, I couldn‚Äôt be happier.

If you decide it isn‚Äôt for you, there are a ton of other ways to find a close knit group.

I recommend rushing to those looking for more friends. But since it‚Äôs winter semester recruitment, I really recommend trying to meet people other ways and make great friends first semester. Then you can see what they are doing. If they are rushing, rush. But if they aren‚Äôt and you have really bonded then don‚Äôt.",thisisjunk643,0

There are lot of terrible professors and most concepts you learn do not translate well into industry at all. For example, your basic Econ 101 , 102, 401, 402 sequence is quite frankly inadequate for anything. It does not teach you Econ well enough for you to be an economist and also does not teaching you broad enough for you to get another job. Their specialize courses such as ECON 310 Money and Banking are just a joke. I realized this by the end of my sophomore year and decided to take the Ross minor also in addition to taking a lot of Math courses. If you want go into high finance on the analyst side of things, do math. Do a lot of math. Take Stats 425, basic calc courses and Math 217, 423, 472, and 474. If you want to go into trading, considering doing a Ross minor and find some good internships. Eitherway honestly, I would just get a Stat or Math major in general if you want to do high finance and minor in Econ if you are interesting Econ. If you are still determined to do Economics because you are interest in it, well I would recommend taking Econ 451 and 452 just so you have good understand of what Economic's core, Econometric, is all about and the professors teaching these classes are generally great.

I recommend you do EECS 203, EECS 280, ROB 101, and ENGR 100 then petition the CS department for ROB 101 to count. This will allow you to take the required classes above for you to do upper level classes starting from your second year.

For CS / Robotics this generally means EECS 203 & EECS 280 (for EECS 281 / 370), physics 140/240 (for EECS 215, MECH240), math, and stats. The other required classes that aren‚Äôt prereqs like chem or IB can be done whenever. 

I also recommend taking your math and physics classes at a community college if you aren‚Äôt interested in the theory / honors courses. You can do them for cheap at a higher quality than Michigan math classes. In fact, WCC (the community college right beside U-M) currently still has spots for calc 1 remote.

For Michigan residents whose family makes less than 75k/year (and some families 100k/year), the school will cover your cost of attendance 100% of the way. You'll even get some money back for personal expenses or to put away into your savings that you won't have to pay back. 

  
If you're going to take out loans, you'll definitely want to take subsidized over unsubsidized loans. Subsidized loans won't accrue interest until like 6 months after you graduate. I have friends who took subsidized loans for tuition and then paid for housing by working a part-time the entirety of undergrad.

  
It's hard to really know whether or not you should take a lot of loans because it should be based on the ROI (return on investment) from your intended career pathway. Even then, if you have like 300k in loans after undergrad/grad school, and you're going into healthcare, you can apply for public service loan forgiveness programs in which you'll end up paying only a portion of your loans.

I suggest looking into the community college if they offer a certificate pathway instead, or medical assisting programs in your area. Here‚Äôs one I found:

It‚Äôs about 5 month-long program + 100 hours of externship. My program was less time than this, so you could search around to see if you can find a program with a shorter duration.

6414,2024-07-19 13:35:05,0,"If you are under the age of I think 26? Or something, you can only file under your parents for financial aid. I‚Äôm pretty sure that regardless of if you file your taxes from your jobs as independent or dependent, financial aid will process the aid from your parents income. The only exceptions to this is if you are legally emancipated, orphan, married I think, and a few other things. Getting a job will not impact the aid you get based on your parents income lol. You need to read up on this in the student aid website and look into it for yourself. There‚Äôs a reason why so many people have issues with financial aid especially for the students that have been very independent and supporting themselves through their low incomes but aren‚Äôt able to escape their parents income which is what their aid is evaluated by. So many kids are stuck in situations where their parents income holds them back from getting grants but the parents won‚Äôt support them even though they are the single defining factor for if they can afford school or not. And if this is the case for you, which it most likely is, I would look into getting better jobs off campus because the student employment typically doesn‚Äôt pay much.
Edit: the finaid website says as such ""You can only qualify as an independent student on the FAFSA if you are at least 24 years of age, married, on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces, financially supporting dependent children, an orphan (both parents deceased), a ward of the court, or an emancipated minor."" And they do take your income into evaluation along with it but if it's not some significant amount like over 15k it's likely not going to affect it. I made 45k previous years and still got good aid that was primarily based on my dad‚Äôs income which was on the low side.",henny4797,2

The sad reality is that state universities are largely only an affordable option for residents of the same state.  Financial aid can do a lot to increase options for families who need the help, but public institutions primarily serve the affordability goals of the states they are in, and don't have enough financial aid to make it widely affordable for residents of other states.  Making all colleges affordable for all families is not a national priority here (even though we seem to promote the value/importance of a college education to all who want it).  That means that the choices of some families are going to be narrower, and if they want to attend a public institution those choices will be even more narrowly defined by where they live.

I think you're making a responsible decision not to take on lots of debt.  Good luck on your college journey--when choosing colleges there is a lot of emphasis on finding ""the right campus"" but the real truth is that a motivated student can have an excellent and fulfilling experience at any number of campuses.",FeatofClay,38

6522,2024-07-17 23:19:06,9,"**TLDR: RA job doesn't compensate as well anymore and it is on the frustrating end for the average person. Since you already have a lease, you will have to deal with the sublease and loose money on that. I'd do a quick math on how much you can make working 10-15 hours a week (realistic RA hours) as well as 2 weeks full time before school in the summer (RA training) to see if that helps you pay your rent and food in your current living arrangement. Also: Do a sanity check in whether you are ready to deal with dorm BS that happens day-to-day**  



So numerous close friends of mine were RAs for 2 years in undergrad so I was able to gather a good understanding of the workload and what the job entails from them:

**Workload**

1) **Required workload of RAs is very much dependent on your hall director.** There was a trend during my undergrad days that housing upper management started requiring RAs to meet and log interactions with students but in the end your hall director decides on how much emphasis to give for that job. 

2) **How much work you do is dependent on yourself.** For the events you have to hold every month you can do simple things like board game night and tea hour in the lounges near your community with 0 effort or you can book a room to organize movie nights and get funding for popcorn etc. where you have to do more hands on work. 

3) **RA work on paper and actuality differs.** On paper you work 20 hours a week but in reality due to points 1 and 2 above your actual week to week work is much lower. There are a lot of unnecessary mandatory meetings that eat up time for RAs but you can sneak some course work into those or just zone out. 

**Compensation**

As with the workload, RA compensation on paper is very different from the reality. 

1) On paper you are being compensated for a single room in a dorm with free dining, last I checked worth over 14,000 over 2 semesters (8 months). On a hourly basis, taking 20 as the baseline, this used to be roughly $22/hour. Back when average wages for on campus jobs like dining were $10/hour this was pretty good. Yet, nowadays with the increases to minimum wages across the campus ($15/hour, usually more), the pay differential is not as good. 

2) The the hourly compensation is based on a single room and 20h/week work assumption but in reality, you should compare to other housing options you have (in this case, compare to what you can make outside of being an RA and compare it to your current lease and what you pay for food on average.)

Finally:

**Working as an RA**  
RA positions can be frustrating since 

1) **the housing has this idea that every residents wants to have a older sibling relationship with their RA in reality most residents do not want to deal with their RA**, the person that has to write them up for alcohol, noise, etc. As such you have to fight an **uphill battle of trying to hang out with residents and get to know them well (as mandated by your job).** 

2) **If you are on duty you are waken up late at night** to deal with necessities like lockouts but mostly for immature stuff like light-drunk students playing their music too loud in their room or being loud in lounges as well as occasionally serious stuff (heavy-drunk students passing out or puking in public spaces and more) . You have to (not all RAs do this though) walk across the entire building and check bathrooms (can be time consuming depending on the size of the building) and finally have to **wake up early to return the phone they call.** 

3) **Housing management is incompetent and overbearing. There are numerous mandatory meetings that accomplish nothing**, the management comes up with stupid policies that make your job harder, and a lot of other annoying stuff are imposed on you

Finally, working as an RA is something you will most likely remove from your resume after you graduate and get an adult job so it doesn't help you advance your career as research assistant or IA positions

**A Big Positive: Easy to get Rehired**

Housing is desperate for getting returning RAs to handle practical training so it is usually easy to get rehired. Most students RA as 3rd and 4th years so there is always large turnover nearly necessitating rehiring most RAs as long as they did not screw up bad. As long as you do a OK job, you have free housing until you graduate (especially good if you become a RA as a sophomore)",RunningEncyclopedia,1

6543,2024-07-17 13:19:49,1,"So to start I'll say that U of M does have some ""weeder"" premed classes. Some of the prereqs are brutally tough like biochem, Orgo and even the bio classes and you'll have to take those regardless of major.

That being said you have a few options for majors. The one that will cover every single prereq relatively comfortably is probably neuroscience at LSA. Tons of premed go neuroscience.

If you're good at math and want a more ""interesting"" major then biomedical engineering is solid. It also gives you options to go into engineering if premed doesn't work out or you change your mind. Some people are against BME for premed because theoretically those early extra math classes might hurt your gpa if you're not the greatest at math but nearly 30% of BME students at U of M are premed. Lots of interesting projects and cutting edge research in biomedical engineering, tissue engineering, genetics etc. although to be honest there is no shortage of research even in LSA.

College of Engineering does also have a lower acceptance rate though.

You can do premed with literally ANY major but itll just mean lots of extra classes if your major doesn't have much overlap with prereq courses.",pegasusCK,2

6568,2024-07-17 02:36:08,25,"There was a spending bill enacted by Congress in 2020 that didn't go into effect until THIS year (The 2020 FAFSA Simplification Act), which required the Department of Education to ""reform"" its costs. IE cost cutting. Not to be political, but this was under the previous administration and their need to cut ""welfare"" programs.

For that reason, they had a completely new application for FAFSA this year that had many issues at launch. It also completely changed how your FAFSA aid is even calculated.

Previously, FAFSA was calculated using the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) formula. Now they come up with a new formula... ""the Student Aid Index (SAI)"" which removes aid from a lot of people.

Google ""How is the SAI different from the EFC?"" Most people will either find it worse or the same but not better.

One key difference is that if you have a sibling in college, you got absolutely reamed. They completely removed considerations for having more than one child in college simultaneously. There are a few other changes that screwed people too but that's the one that really hurts the most and to the most families.

I don't really understand where you get ""¬†under the previous administration and their need to cut ""welfare"" programs."" from... when it was a congressional action under a yearly spending bill.

It has been carried out by the current administrations cabinet member Miguel Cardona, so the handling of FAFSA you see now is there's. They had awhile to prepare, so there are no excuses there.

And in Michigan's case they grant aid based on the CSS profile, and even deduct based on the FAFSA grant. In the posters case that happened to them. Most of the people saying that they can't afford it are OOS students, and for very good reason, it costs a lot. I'd say this poster has a different situation as their families income has changed.

6627,2024-07-16 21:38:32,6,"There are not many jobs in cybersecurity you can get with just 388. Cybersecurity has a problem with very few entry-level positions but has many mid to high-end job openings. The majority of cybersecurity jobs are on the IT side of things. 388 (and your EECS degree) are more on the engineering side. Pentester jobs are quite hard to get into and will be nearly impossible if all your exposure to cybersecurity is 388. Ethical hacker in terms of job titles isn't really a thing in most cases. There is the certified ethical hacker exam but because it is so broad it tends to apply to only analyst jobs (which are not entry-level typically).

Your easiest bet is getting a defense contracting job that is on the software engineering side of cybersecurity.

Most people in cybersecurity are predominately self-taught and many end up here from other careers, so there isn't uniform advice to give you. There are many avenues to break into cybersecurity without employment though, bug bounties and capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions don't require anything besides a laptop and your time. Do enough of those and you will get job offers. What set me on my cybersecurity career was winning some CTF competitions at some cybersecurity competitions.",_iQlusion,14

2) After your first year your retirement contributions are matched 2-1 up to 5% of your salary so if you earn $100 and contribute $5, UofM matches it with $10! 

3) Tuition reimbursement programs for taking courses at UofM and academic departments usually pay for workshops etc.

4) Free public transportation in Washtenaw county

5) (Edit): I forgot decent PTO. It is not high on paper but you get between Christmas and New Year off whereas private sector might not necessarily do so.

Finally, Midwest has relatively lower cost of living even if AA is a bit expensive. Commuting is an option with free public transportation.

Starting the intro to bio sequence, statistics (I took 250 and thought it was okay), and a calc class (I don‚Äôt know whether you have AP credit or not, or your standing) can help with knocking out the prereqs while also satisfying some med school course requirements.

Orgo and physics are MCDB prereqs and important coursework for med apps, but they‚Äôre very time consuming and can be difficult.

However you could do CoE and just take math classes that you find interesting, without receiving a degree in the end. Engineering physics is identical to LSA physics except you have CoE requirements rather than LSA, so if you‚Äôd rather take technical electives like Materials Science / CS / etc than things like language / history / etc, go into CoE.

6797,2024-07-15 02:22:12,0,"In my experience having an engineering degree opens up alot more career opprtunities and doesn't really shut you out of any other careers that request other science based degrees. I would recommend going straight into CoE and planning on majoring in Engineering Physics, unless something else really speaks to you while you're there. One exception - if you plan on going into academia, I would go with the school you plan on teaching/researching in.



Regarding double majoring, I rarely see the value in doing so. It adds extra cost, time, and stress in exchange for essentially zero real world benefit (I cannot see any employer valuing an added math major when you already have an Engineering degree they were originally looking for). Seriously, I have seen so many people get double majors and not a single one that I know of has been able to take advantage of it. I would only do it if it's something you are really passionate about.",thejigglynaut,1

2. absolutely. you get far more benefits and opportunities in CoE. People in CoE are very different from people in LSA. for example, people in CoE are more practical and concern/motivated about their career more.

3. Yes but you have to complete LSA‚Äôs language and race requirements. Imo, they are just a waste of time for STEM students. It‚Äôs possible if you already have some AP credits. Alternatively, you can just get minors from LSA, which are not subject to those requirements. Note it‚Äôs easier to double major within your college.

This is a common issue; students and their parents are told all through high school that AP and IB credits are enormously valuable and you should maximize how much college credit you earn from them. However, the reality on a particular campus may be different.   Lots of public universities in Michigan have the lower/upper tuition structure, so that's one factor.  Also, the fact that at UM you pay ""threshold"" tuition (rather than per credit hour) means that you don't necessarily ""save money"" on the classes that you place out of, unless placing out of them actually shortens the number of semesters you pay tuition.  There may be other benefits but saying on tuition may not be one of them.

6861,2024-07-14 12:41:38,0,"Look, I don't know if it was RC advising for me or movies setting unrealistic expectations, but in the end UofM advising is mostly useless except helping you navigate the requirements of UofM that you need for graduation. When I was an undergrad here, I planned ~~most~~ all of my courses myself and never needed advising appointments after my first semester (except for the official signatures). I got a 4 year (later 5 with my sequential masters) master plan with all my core courses and preferred electives that stayed roughly constant for core courses and changed only on elective availability after my 1st year. I know I might be an outlier but I'd say it is doable for most students, especially for those with popular majors.

Even if you don't want to plan everything yourself and tap into the experience of advisors (if you can get a hold of them), here's what I'd suggest you do in your case with missing the advising appointment:

1. Read about LSA requirements and your prospective major requirements, make an Excel sheet for courses you need to take
2. Take the placement exams you can and get the score
3. Depending on your placement test results, take register in courses through Wolverine Access (the only part that you need guidance the first time around given the un-intutive nature of the system)

**General Outline In Case You Cannot Get a Hold of An Advisor**  
For most (barring exceptional cases with immense AP/dual enrollment credit) social science and natural science  majors, courses the first semester courses are roughly similar:

1. **Depending on previous credits people take a Calculus course** (Calc 1-3). In your case with a 5 in Calc AB you will likely take Calc 2, MATH 116. Once you pass your 2 credits for Calc AB will become 4 (same for Calc BC where you get 2+2 credits that get completed to 4+4 once you pass MATH 215)
2. **People** **~~likely~~** **take a first year writing course (as far as I recall it is next to impossible to waive this requirement).** If you are in Honors program or the Residential College, you have their version but most students take a section of ENGLISH 125 (correct me if I am wrong Reddit). There might be other options too
3. **For most majors, people likely take Introduction to Statistics** **(like STATS 250) since the AP Stats does not satisfy the statistic requirement**. If you have AP credit you can take Honors Statistic (STATS 280) or if you have AP credit plus Calc 3 (take it right away or dual enrollment credit), you can take STATS 412 or the STATS 425-426 sequence. In your case it will be either of 250 or 280 since stats is most likely a requirement for Pysch. Some majors have their version of introduction to statistics but courses like STATS 250 satisfy the requirement for all majors whereas majors specific ones usually do so only for that major as such you cannot go wrong with it.
4. **After that, most people take other intro courses for their major** like  ECON 101-102 (again, AP credits do not satisfy the requirement, only IB does), Physics 1-2 sequence (barring AP credit), organic chemistry or general chemistry (depending on placement exam scores), intro to psychology, sociology, and other similar intro courses. In your case you have to find out if AP Psychology counts as Intro to psychology (as afformentioned, it doesn't do so for econ and stats) and take an intro course if it does not. 
5. **Finally, a lot of students take language courses for the LSA language requirement.** For larger departments there are placement exams available (Spanish, German, French etc.) whereas for smaller departments/language teams (like Czech, Swedish, Azerbaijani etc.) you will be told to reach to the specific faculty members who will prepare exams depending on if there is any interest (they do not have placement exams by default due to lack of demand).

Unfortunately, in college (maybe apart from your first semester) you will not be hand-held and will need to research and find stuff on your own. I'd say finding an upperclassmen through clubs etc. to mentor you would be invaluable otherwise just sit down with an Excel sheet and read department websites and LSA requirements until you have an 8 semester (4-year) plan (preferably with all core courses) that you revise with updated information. I'd say go and register to Calc 2 (MATH 116), either one of STATS 250 or 280 (research this for your own decision), Physchology departments intro course (there is 2 if I recall, research pros and cons of each), first year writing (ENGLISH 125 or another course that satisfies it) and finally a language course if applicable (otherwise a general elective). Unfortunately, as an adult you have to find ways to resolve your problems (like step away from family matters to call or email advising)",RunningEncyclopedia,3

When I used to have Obamacare, a comparable plan was over $400/mo, and that's without inflation since I had that for a year or 2 about 10 years ago. Unfortunately, your status as a student will make it difficult for you to qualify for any type of government subsidy. Obamacare waivers are based on income and how much you've paid in taxes, so unless you had a full time job you probably didn't make enough money to qualify for those (I found that out the hard way). 

If you'll be taking classes during summer too, you'll have access to the student clinic as long as you're taking classes and enrolled. You could see if there is a cheaper marketplace plan with less coverage with the intention of primarily using the free student clinic. The clinic has long wait times and this option is risky since most specialists aren't covered if you were to need specialized care, and prescriptions would be full price (thiugh goodrx can help).

It's 100% legal to move assets into a business for various financial and tax benefits. I do it regularly for various reasons. If you don't like the practice, talk to your congressman.

You don't report the business assets on your FAFSA. So on your application, it looks like many existing assets just dropped off. So they ask for further clarification and you can present that transfer of title/deed. 

> Also not trying to be like that but IDK how many parents can just hire a CPA to be able to try to get lower tuition for this.

You don't have to, I just made that statement to cover my ass and you shouldn't take the advice of strangers online at face value. I didn't personally hire a CPA or a lawyer. I just read over the law and noticed that loophole when it came to personal versus business assets. I am just personally interested and read a ton about finance and taxes. The stuff isn't that complicated and I figured it out as a non-finance major (or related majors).

> but still I think you gotta be a bit careful giving this out

Hence why I said to consult an attorney and/or CPA.

> Speaking from experience fraud ain‚Äôt no joke, but it happens all the time for people who know better about systems than us.

Legally moving your assets, like your home, to a business is not fraud. Hence why the director of financial aid didn't have a problem with it. 

Honestly, your post comes off as someone who's salty that someone else figured out how to legally get more out of financial aid by simply understanding what the law/regulations are. I come from a poor background and didn't start my undergrad until I was 23. I bought a house right before I started at UMich since my GI Bill benefits would cover my mortgage and the house contributed to me getting lower financial aid. I read over the law/regulations to maximize my financial aid on my own.

After that first week, I immediately had a social circle and could walk anywhere on campus with the knowledge that I at least had a couple of friends I could count on. As the months go by, participants do split up and join different student organizations, but that makes it all the more merrier when you find yourself becoming involved with others outside of your assigned family group. The volunteers/ ‚Äúparents‚Äù of the program have also become really great mentors to me and have given pointers into different opportunities on campus. 

Overall, despite the fact that I didn‚Äôt know anyone doing ALMA with me, and being out of state, I really think it was an amazing experience and really made me feel much more confident at U of M, instantaneously. 

Whether you end up signing up or not, just know that you‚Äôre exactly where you‚Äôre supposed to be :) 

ALMA was that for me, because I came from a predominantly Hispanic environment and knew I needed that space and that community right away. Outside of ALMA participation, there is La Casa, and several other Latinx student orgs you can find on Maize Pages. The first week or so on campus, La Casa holds an event called Un√©te, where they invite all Latinx affiliated orgs to come and table. There is also Latinx Heritage Month, which I really enjoyed attending events for, and I‚Äôm also on the committee for this year.",Fit_Number8228,2

This spring I won the Big House 5k in Ann Arbor. As a prize, I was given two box seat tickets to Michigan vs Texas on September 7th. Unfortunately, I'm out of town and won't be able to attend.

Based on prices I'm seeing online, I believe these tickets are worth at least 1k each. First person to offers me 2k for the pair gets 'em. Throw me your lowballs as well. I prefer to meet in person in Ann Arbor for the transfer. Payment via cash, venmo, or zelle.

Feel free to share with friends and DM me. If you DM, I'll send you a screenshot of the tickets in my goblue account, a render of the view from the seats, and a photo of me winning the race (i know it's lame). this is real, not a scam...idk how else to establish legitimacy.",ballsaklow,1

That said, it's completely normal and common to be apprehensive about taking an alternate pathway into CS 2, and there is a bit of adjustment to a new language at the start of the term. But, you've got a strong foundation in programming and much will translate without too many hiccups.


Also, rumor has it that they're making adjustments to EECS 280 starting next Fall so that it includes a brief introduction to C++ at the start.

You're going to have classes where you don't jive with how the professor is presenting the material, and in those situations no amount of going over your lecture notes or re-reading textbook chapters is going to fix the problem. These days there are so many external resources for any given subject that you can virtually always find some information source that works better for you.

- Spend at least one spring/summer in Ann Arbor. May & June are the best months.  In July & August head to the river for a float or kayak to stay cool. 

- Find a talk therapist w/ CAPS or private practice before you have a problem or feel lonely or depressed. Many people don‚Äôt realize that they can help you navigate the good times too. 

- Plan to vote w/ an absentee ballot & encourage others.  Lines are ridiculously long on Election Day

- Try joining club‚Äôs or at least attending a few meetings that are different from your typical interests.  This is the time to explore & expand your experiences

1) Learn to be independent. By the time you exit college, you should be able to buy groceries, cook, do your own laundry, maintain a tidy apartment, organize your schedule, and live a healthy life. 

2) EXERCISE!!! HOLY SHIT BRO USE THE GYM!! I have 0 regrets about it anything related to dating or partying or academics despite MANY fumbles, but GO TO THE GYM (or do inter mural sports or calisthenics). There is a free university gym and there are multiple athletic teams and clubs devoted to fitness. This is how you avoid the massive problems with a sedentary lifestyle, and your college body is the most amenable to rigorous exercise.

3) HAVE A PLAN. You should exit college with either a job or grad/phd admission. This means grinding internships and doing well in classes. College is very expensive. 

4) Be ok with a boring, yet responsible college experience. You shouldn‚Äôt get wasted at parties and you should not have sex without 2 forms of birth control and STD tests on both sides. You should not do hard drugs and you should accept that most of your Friday‚Äôs are better spent on building up your portfolio to show to employers/grad school admissions.",Bussinessbacca,4

If you are undeclared or unsure about your major, make a list of the majors you are interested in and take 1-2 classes in each before deciding. These classes should count toward the major if you decide to pursue it. If they don‚Äôt, it would be great if they counted towards a minor you‚Äôre interested in or your college-wide distribution requirements.

If you know what you want to study, email an advisor to ask about the prerequisites for declaring your major and the earliest you can officially declare. Enroll in those prerequisite classes as soon as possible.

In the meantime, download your ‚Äúaudit checklist‚Äù to review your school-wide requirements and start fulfilling those. Note that if you‚Äôre in LSA, classes in your major cannot count towards your LSA requirements. Try to test out of the language requirement if possible, as language classes can be a significant challenge and may affect your GPA, which is important for graduate school or the workforce.

This is key, and you don't really realize how unique that is until later. Same thing joining the military with a batch of new recruits. But thereafter, most new situations you enter (joining a company, moving to a new neighborhood or city, entering a retirement home) are going to be with people who have established friends nearby already. Even moving into a newly opened apartment building, most new tenants will already have friends in the city.

Most of your dormmates will be freshman, freshly arrived from outside the city, looking for friends, and eager to experience new things. It's a golden opportunity to make good friends.

I took Math 156 and I can without a doubt say that this is a MUST TAKE over Math 116. Yeah it‚Äôs an honors class, but most of the time the class gets curved (i.e. B -> A-). If possible take this with Prof Krasny or Wheeler. Either prof is a guaranteed A. For you who has a solid math background, this is overall an easy class. Of course, some topics in infinite series and integration can be really tricky, but if you seriously had little to no issue / confusion in Calculus 1, you‚Äôll be more than fine.

Lastly Physics 140: I got a 3 in AP PhysC mechanics, so this class was still difficult. ig mechanics never clicked with me. Both Prof Popov and Tom Schwarz are pretty solid professors though. However if you like multiple choice exams, take Popov. And for free response exams with partial credit, take Schwarz.

class: show up to lectures. best possible way to advance your understanding. try not to spend class time taking excessive notes‚Äîmany classes upload lecture notes and you‚Äôre better off listening to what your professor is actually trying to say instead of spending most of your efforts in class transcribing their words. try to review the lecture material a couple hours after to help retainment and understanding.

homework: start early, ask for help. the best part of starting early is that you have more time to digest the questions and actually participate in the problem solving method. you don‚Äôt learn much if you try to cram all the solutions in 1 day before the due date.

exams: biggest discovery‚Äîthe point of most stem exams is testing your active recall ability. i stress this, because this concept should drive your review techniques. don‚Äôt try and memorize concepts‚Äîtake tons of practice exams and past homework and lecture problems so you can internalize the key problem solving structures that will be required. very tired point, but understand instead of memorize, so you can work from first principles instead of trying to replicate a process you don‚Äôt really understand.

If a big project is assigned i usually start it the day of, not to completion or even halfway but a start. I use my apple calender a lot. with smaller weekly assignments i get it done days in advance if possible. Many people wait to the last minute and that just stresses me out if i do that. So if youre like me and want to reduce stress don't wait till the last minute. In class, i use my iPad and notability while writing over the slides that ive downloaded from the course. On Sundays, i usually look at the syllabus and download any slides or supporting documents i need for the week. Essays is probably the only thing i wait till the week of to complete because for me its easy and i can finish a 5-page essay in a single sitting. As with dealing with GSI or tough professors, the only advice i can give is to look at the syllabus and follow it to a T. If you follow that you should be fine. Disclaimer this works for me, it might not work for everyone. I know people that do the exact opposite and wait till the last minute and dont plan anything and get 4.0 GPA but i feel like thats the exception not the norm as well as gifted students that can do that. Finally, be honest with yourself, if math is something you struggle with then take some more time doing practice math problems and not as much time in essay writing if essay writing is easy for you. It's okay if you need extra help. I see a lot of students comparing themselves to each other and i feel like you're setting yourself up for failure if you do that.

I'll then write out all the information into a comment on the side, trying to spit out everything I know and rewriting all the bullets until I get everything correct (I'll rewrite the ones I got wrong first). Doing this again the next few days helps a ton. 
4. Associating information with silly phrases or words or mnemonics. This helps a TON and makes it sm easier for me to correlate ideas, topics, etc.",Mundane_Screen5537,1

I recommend working in groups as much as possible. Reading and taking notes don‚Äôt work as well for me as active recall, but ‚Äúteaching‚Äù someone a topic has worked really well for me. Try to explain an event or idea in the most basic terms possible helps you find exactly where you struggle so you can go back and relearn it.

As far as essays go, peer reviewing helps me a lot. Find a few people who will read through your essays and give you honest feedback while you‚Äôre drafting so you know what to fix and how you can improve your writing as a whole.

Lastly, block your time. Jumping between classes and assignments makes it hard to remember any one thing that well. Instead, focus on doing whatever‚Äôs on your to do list for one class at a time, take breaks as needed, and set reasonable goals and rewards. Like, ‚Äúif finish my rough draft, I earn a coffee trip‚Äù. But if you only do part of your rough draft for psych, then switch to the reading for chem, then review your notes for stats, you‚Äôre not going to remember any of those things as well as you would if you blocked your time.",icantdoeyeliner,0

UofM‚Äôs lingua franca for stats major is R. R coursework (306) is required and most courses expect you to know it. Python is used for data science in real life but it is less straightforward compared to R. UofM has a python Coursera sequence you can take for free and get some certs.

You will have to take EECS 183 to for Stats/DS major but you will not use C++ unless you do large simulation based inference and need C snippets (super rare).

If you want to learn a language before school just for fun, STATA, R, and sometimes Python are standard in the social sciences.

You can't really pick a specific school for example Hopkins because students coming out of umich can be drastically different. You can get a umich grad with 3.98 and 522 MCAT and another with 3.62 and 504 MCAT which massively changes the school list to apply to.",pegasusCK,12

Ask your friends about groupme chats and facebook pages meant for ticket selling. Be super careful about scammers. A typical scam strategy is to send a screenshot of the ticket but there's no timestamp and it looks shady. Most legit people will not mind drawing something custom on a screenshot of their digital ticket or offering some type of proof they are not a scam. Be patient and don't buy the first thing you see from these groups.

  
Additionally, if you're in a dorm, theres usually a dorm groupchat of some sort and there's almost always people trying to get rid of a ticket last minute. I haven't personally seen snapchat be used for this like other people have mentioned but i guess thats a thing?? big games like MSU/OSU will run you more. Expect \~100-200 for MSU and \~200-400 for OSU but those aren't what you're asking for. If texas/oregon are ranked higher like they have been in the past, i'd expect 50-100 but you can likely find something for around 50/60.

Unfortunately, there also was a mechanism established where the President of CSG can fill vacancies if student governments don't act quick enough (30 work days roughly) and I was unsuccessful in trying to repeal that shortsighted policy.

Edit: Forgot to mention that these nominees still have to be vetted but it is extremely rare for CSG to reject executive nominees without specific reasons to do so. We will see if this changes over the coming months",tylerfioritto,10

Right now, the executive is vetoing budgets while 2/3 of the Assembly is required to override a veto.  If Shut It Down shrinks even further tonight, the 24-10 margin (with the vacancies not factoring in like the US House of Representatives), there is a real shot that the budget passes tonight",tylerfioritto,3

7919,2024-07-08 18:57:09,28,"I did my undergrad at Alabama 2016-2020 (like, around peak Bama), and the freshman ticket packages were split into 3 instead of 2, so people only got to go to 2-3 games (if they didnt seek out extra tickets during the season). 

They did have a kinda nice system, where if you didn‚Äôt use your ticket, you would get negative points (there were no positive points), and if you got a certain number of negative points, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to get tickets the next season. To avoid the negative points, if you couldn‚Äôt go to a game, you could sell the ticket (once it‚Äôs transferred, it‚Äôs on THAT person to use the ticket, not you) or donate the ticket to the lottery (no negative points if donated by Wednesday, partial negative points if donated after wednesday). So then students that didn‚Äôt have tickets for a particular game could apply to the lottery for that game and have a chance of receiving someone‚Äôs unused ticket (for free). It was also easy to find people giving away tickets for free on ticket groups on the morning of games (because they wanted to avoid the partial negative points from donating to the lottery late). 

I think a donation/lottery system would be nice at umich, especially if they‚Äôre doing partial ticket packages like this now (even without adding negative consequences to unused tickets).",caffa4,12

7970,2024-07-08 14:25:37,2,"As another international student I'm going to be honest: The biggest difficulty you will have is not Ross vs LSA-Econ, but being an international. A lot of small firms do not want to deal with the hassle of hiring international students and for larger firms, given that OPT is 1 or 3 years, it can sometimes be hard to justify hiring internationals since H1 visas are lottery based and they employee that they invest a lot of time training/getting more efficient might not be around to yield returns after their OPT. There are a lot of international students still hired despite these setbacks; however, I have personally noticed it is getting harder and harder.

I am not sure if UofM Econ program counts as STEM (for the purposes of USCIS BS vs BA Econ is irrelevant, it depends on major code assigned to the program), but I'd try to get a secondary major to complement econ that is STEM (stats, or math sub-majors like [Math Sciences for Econ](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/mathematical-sciences.html) or [Financial Math](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/mathematics-of-finance-and-risk-management.html) ) and shoot for roles that use those skills from the complementary major so you are eligible for a OPT-STEM extension (your job must build on skills from your STEM major to be eligible). STEM extension is an additional 2 years of OPT so it might not only help getting a job but keeping it if you are unlucky in the H1 lottery.

My undergrad at UofM was in econ with two additional complementary STEM majors.",RunningEncyclopedia,5

Furthermore, engineering degrees are always seen as superior with industrial engineering being our equivalent (in terms of prestige) of business degree. In general for my friends who did end up going back, the major advantage ended up being the prestige of a US degree from top ranked schools (preferably from an in-demand major) as opposed to prestige factors like Ross vs LSA Econ (or generalizing to other schools, BBA vs Econ)

7991,2024-07-08 03:13:03,0,"EECS 203, 280, Physics 140 are all classes that freshmen tend to struggle in. But of course not everybody will struggle in every class.

Here's what I will say for each of those classes:

If you are an experienced programmer, EECS 280 won't be much work at all as you'll probably be able to finish the projects in a couple days (5 projects and 2 exams). If you are newer to programming and only have basic (think AP Comp Sci equivalent) experience, especially if it's not with C++, then you might struggle a bit and take longer on the projects and studying.

EECS 203 is one of those classes that are just are you naturally good at the material and enjoy it or not. People who are naturally good at discrete math will like it and do well. People who are just naturally not good at discrete math will hate the class and really struggle. Make sure to get a good study group for this one, there's also group work assigned each week as well. Please don't let this class turn you off from EECS though.

Physics 140 is a tough one. If you take the lecture section with Yuri Popov, the averages for each exam is like 65-70%. If you take a while to ingest the material and prefer more interaction to learn, take the studio section and not the lecture section. Popov goes through slides very quickly and you basically have to learn most of it yourself outside of class. Since you already did pretty good on AP Physics though, you‚Äôll most likely be fine in this class since it‚Äôs made for people who have little to no physics experience.

Physics 141 is very GSI dependent. The lab material is all very easy and straightforward but some GSI's grade harsher than others. You'll probably get an A either way, just the amount of effort you need to put in might be vary",HappyWolverine1324,7
7992,2024-07-08 03:13:03,0,"This would leave little margin for error.  Lots of classes that move quickly and grade with rigor.  Some people transition easily, others have a bit of adjustment with college courses.  Two things to consider if you can adjust - 1) take your first year writing requirement in place of one of these quant classes.  It is just a different way to think and the workload is lighter.  And you have to do it anyway at some point. 2) look for first year seminars that might interest you.  You can take these other courses later, but this is the only year for the first year seminars.
Bottom line, might work fine, but if it were me I would consider building in a little more room for adjustment.  I know people who have found each of those courses doable and people who have struggled in each.  All of them were strong high school students with solid backgrounds.",meggedagain,2

Check out both courses on Atlas. You'll see workload is rated slightly higher for the honors class but I bet you the percentage of A+, A and A- are all higher while also having a lower drop rate.

8056,2024-07-06 23:09:08,6,"Best to ask the financial aid office but here's how it was done for me.¬†


Let me give you an example first. Say I had a total aid of 76k(grants, scholarship, loans, work study), and my total cost is 81k. My EFC(SAI now but let's focus on EFC) was 0, so I was expected to need full aid, or 81k. Now say I got a 6k scholarship and that puts my total aid to 82k. Because that goes over my full need or total cost(I'm not sure which hence why you should contact the financial aid office), the financial aid office will remove some of the aid they gave to Match. Usually, they'll focus on removing 1k from your loans or work study first, then focus on their own university grants. Once done and the total aid matches, then you're pretty much done.¬†


¬†How my situation was I received a 5k scholarship but I made the university save that 5k for sophomore year. The reasoning was that I had received full aid in my first year, and 2nd year my costs were gonna increase but enough where my aid + the 5k would be fine, ignoring that they would remove loans and work study in my aid package.¬†",Previous-Sky6501,5

The prof I had for 3 was way better than for 4 so I did better as a result. Keep in mind though that the classes are pretty curved.

If your financial situation is the same the university might give you additional aid as a supplemental award if they have the resources. Once you get your official financial aid notice from the school you could try to appeal if they don't give you more but no guarantees (I've heard appeals are unlikely to succeed).,Critical-Winner-3509,14

I‚Äôm going to guess that you‚Äôre a FY student who hasn‚Äôt had the true college experience yet and that you‚Äôre somewhat interested in CS or u wouldn‚Äôt have applied. If you end up liking CS more than you like med, you have a possible major and future u can pursue in college. If u liked it but didn‚Äôt see it smth u wanna continue you‚Äôre right back where u started. If you do it tho, do it with an open mind. Don‚Äôt go in with any expectations or ideas about the field and topics. That‚Äôs gonna make it so much easier to find out where ur true passion lies. 

FYI: Im an incoming freshman w no experience with the actual kickstart program. I have some experience in CS and coding if you wanna chat tho",Silver_Painting6169,6
8323,2024-07-02 12:35:36,9,"CS Kickstart alum and board member here :)

Honestly, I originally applied for similar reasons - I wanted to move in early and thought it would be a cool skill/industry to learn more about, even though I had no experience with CS and was planning on majoring in another engineering capability. I ended up having a really positive experience with the program and it eventually inspired me to switch majors into CS and stay on as CSK leadership so I could help provide that experience to others. That isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs experience, and participation in CSK totally doesn‚Äôt mean you need to switch into CS or even study it, but it‚Äôs a great opportunity to expand your skillset, meet professors and clubs on campus, tour companies and Ann Arbor, and meet a bunch of cool people. 

In anything in life, your mindset informs your experience- if you go in with a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù attitude, you‚Äôll have a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù time. Whatever you decide, make sure you‚Äôre prepared to put in effort to get the most of your experience. If you don‚Äôt feel confident that this is the program for you, all good, just let us know. If you want to try something new with a growth mindset, we‚Äôd love to have you. Let us know if you have any questions or wanna chat! :)",Secret_Art8772,6

8325,2024-07-02 12:35:36,9,"DO IT! Assuming that you do any research at all during your time in undergrad or in med school or beyond, coding is an increasingly desirable skill. Not just to have on a resume, even though that‚Äôs nice, but for your own personal gain. I work in research now and god do I wish I learned to code in undergrad. I could save so much time by automating a lot of processes, so now I have to teach myself to code. 

Even beyond all that, undergrad is for trying new things and building up skill sets that you might not think you‚Äôll need. Take the opportunities you‚Äôre given to be a well-rounded scholar. Always.",another-reddit-noob,2

Also, I really don't think you should pick your major based on your sister's struggles. It really doesn't have much to do with you.",Correct_Beyond265,1
